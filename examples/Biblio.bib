	url = {https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20010035883},
	abstract = {The research described in this paper is focused on two areas:  evaluation of existing composite failure criteria in the nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic finite element code, MSC.Dytran, and  exploration of the possibilities for modification of material and failure models to account for large deformations, progressive failure, and interaction of damage accumulation with stress/strain response of laminated composites. Following a review of the MSC.Dytran user manual, a bibliographical review of existing failure criteria of composites was performed. The papers considered most interesting for the objective of this report are discussed in section 2. The failure criteria included in the code under consideration are discussed in section 3. A critical summary of the present procedures to perform analysis and design of composites is presented in section 4. A study of the most important historical failure criteria for fibrous composite materials and some of the more recent modifications proposed were studied. The result of this analysis highlighted inadequacies in the existing failure criteria and the need to perform some numerical analyses to elucidate the answer to questions on which some of the proposed criteria are based. A summary of these ideas, which is a proposal of studies to be developed, is presented in section 5. Finally, some ideas for future developments are summarized in section 6.},

	abstract = {For both monotonic and fatigue loading conditions, debonding is the subcritical micromechanism which leads to transverse cracking and ultimately influences final failure of the composite structure. Previous studies show that tension–compression fatigue is more detrimental than tension–tension fatigue to transverse and multidirectional laminates. By analysing the debonding mechanisms and modelling thereof, the macroscopic fatigue behaviour can be better understood. Also, the dominant crack-propagation mode can be identified which may be of use in selection of constituent material properties to optimise fatigue resistance. In this study, glass-fibre-reinforced vinyl-ester was used. The adverse effect of compressive load excursions was verified by counting the transverse cracks in cross-ply laminates. The mechanisms were studied in low-cycle fatigue of a specimen containing a single transverse fibre. Compressive load cycles led to significantly increased debond growth. In tension, contact zones developed at the crack tips for sufficiently large debonds. Because of the mismatch in elastic properties, an opening zone appeared at the tips of the interfacial crack when the same debond was subjected to a compressive load. Since debond propagation is more susceptible to mode I loading, the sensitivity to tension–compression fatigue is explained by the effective crack-tip opening in compressive loading for sufficiently large debond cracks. This has also been verified by finite-element analysis.},

An algorithm, initially based on a finite element decomposition of displacement fields, is extended to benefit from discontinuity and singular enrichments over a suited subset of elements. This allows one to measure irregular displacements encountered, say, in cracked solids, as demonstrated both in artificial examples and experimental case studies. Moreover, an optimization strategy for the support of the discontinuity enables one to adjust the crack path configuration to reduce the residual mismatch, and hence to be tailored automatically to a wavy or irregular crack path.

First, the water uptakes of several types of samples are compared. Micro-CT observations show that, from the beginning of desorption but not during the water ageing, damage appears in the composites. At macroscopic scale, tensile tests reveal a significant modification of mechanical properties of the composite after water ageing. Then, an original test, combining tensile loading and X-ray microtomography, is performed on a ±45 hemp/epoxy composite material. The volume of damage inside two specimens (with and without water ageing) at several steps during a tensile test can be quantified. Results highlight significant differences in the evolution of the volume of damage between the two samples. This work shows how the mechanisms of deformation and damage of plant fibre composites are governed by their moisture exposure history.},

Quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates, with stacking sequence [452/902/-452/02]S defined as ply scaled and [45/90/-45/0]2S defined as sub-laminate scaled, were used. Specimens were cycled at 5 Hz with various amplitudes to 1 × 106 cycles unless failure occurred prior to this limit. For all cases an R ratio of 0.1 was used. Bolt washer pressures of 23 MPa and 70 MPa were investigated. For the ply-level case, the quasi-static test showed both delamination and fibre-dominated pull-out failures for a washer pressure of 23 MPa, and pull-out failure only for 70 MPa. Delamination dominates in fatigue tests. For the sub-laminate case the tests failed by pull-out in both quasi-static and fatigue tests for all washer pressures. It is shown in this paper how the role of delamination is critical in the case of fatigue loading and how this interacts with bolt clamp-up forces. A number of tests were analysed for damage using X-ray CT scanning and comparisons of damage are made with tests from previous open-hole studies.},

The images are acquired in-situ with optical cameras and an electron microscope. The strain mapping at the macro- and meso-scales allows semi-automatic detection of matrix cracks and quantification of their density evolution in function of the applied strain. The micro-scale examination provides additional insights into the failure mechanisms. The technique is developed and then applied to characterize transverse cracking in cross-ply carbon fiber/epoxy composites in the absence and presence of manufacturing defects (including voids). Laminates with defects were produced by lowering the autoclave pressure and the cure temperature, intentionally. The strain for cracking onset and the saturation crack density are found to be different in the inner and outer transverse plies of both types of laminates. The change in processing conditions that led to the presence of voids and incomplete matrix cure resulted in a lower strain for cracking onset and up to 3.5 times increase of the crack density in comparison with the reference material without defects.},

Interfacial debond growth in the arc and fibre direction was measured for transparent matrix polymer composites. In the present study, an earlier stress analysis by Toya was modified and combined with a critical energy release rate criterion, taking mode mixity effects into account. The developed model was used to determine interfacial toughness parameters. The model was able to describe and explain the main experimental observations of the debonding process. Treatment of the contact problem present for large debond angles is of interest for future work.},

It is well known that composites can be tailored to achieve desired mechanical and thermal properties in various directions and thus can be made fit-for-purpose if the proper combination of constituent materials and microstructures can be realized. In the present work, the first, multiscale, atomistically-informed, computational analysis of mechanical and thermal properties of a present day - Carbon/Phenolic composite Thermal Protection System  material is conducted. Model results are compared to measured in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical and thermal properties to validate the computational approach. Results indicate that given sufficient microstructural fidelity, along with lowerscale, constituent properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations, accurate composite level  thermo-elastic properties can be obtained. This suggests that next generation TPS properties can be accurately estimated via atomistically informed multiscale analysis.},

Several technically important problems are analyzed, including tunnels in adhesive joints, shear fracture, and kinked tunnels in a reaction product layer. The concept is finally applied to microcracking in brittle matrix composites caused by thermal expansion mismatch.},

Discrete values are determined around a closed contour for plane problems which then become input into a boundary integral equation method in order to calculate surface traction in the contour. Stresses are then calculated within this boundary. The solution procedure is illustrated by a numerical example of a case of uniform tension.},

	abstract = {The local mechanical properties of a dissimilar friction stir welded AA-2024-T3/AA-2198-T3 joint were documented during a uniaxial tensile test. High-resolution digital image correlation was performed during monotonic tensile tests to capture the local in-plane strain fields of the heterogeneous macrostructure of the weld. In the shoulder-affected region, banded macrostructures with heterogeneous mechanical properties were found. They were related to pronounced textures regions, which can be associated to strain-rate gradient during one rotation of the tool. The banded macrostructures in the nugget region were observed to be responsible for early plasticity in the joint and ultimately to be the fracture location of the weld. The heterogeneous mechanical response of the joint was also investigated by microhardness measurements. Differences were found between hardness and local tensile properties, demonstrating microhardness measurements can be misleading and only direct high-resolution digital image correlation techniques can document the mechanical behavior of materials having complex and heterogeneous micro-/macrostructures.},

In spite of the large angle difference, it is shown that the topography can be accurately determined using regularized global Digital Image Correlation. The surface topography is compared to another estimate issued from a 3D FIB-SEM procedure where the sample surface is first covered by a Pt layer, and its initial topography is progressively revealed from successive FIB-milling. These two methods are successfully compared on a 6\% strained steel specimen in an in situ mechanical test. This analysis is supplemented by a third approach estimating the change of topography from crystal rotations as measured from successive EBSD images. This last technique ignores plastic deformation, and thus only holds in an elastic regime. For the studied example, despite the large plastic flow, it is shown that crystal rotation already accounts for a significant part of the deformation-induced topography.},

	abstract = {Finite element (FE) analysis has the potential to offset much of the expensive experimental testing currently required to certify aerospace laminates. However, large numbers of degrees of freedom are necessary to model entire aircraft components whilst accurately resolving micro-scale defects. The new module dune-composites, implemented within DUNE by the authors, provides a tool to efficiently solve large-scale problems using novel iterative solvers. The key innovation is a preconditioner that guarantees a constant number of iterations regardless of the problem size. Its robustness has been shown rigorously in Spillane et al. (2014) for isotropic problems. For anisotropic problems in composites it is verified numerically for the first time in this paper. The parallel implementation in DUNE scales almost optimally over thousands of cores. To demonstrate this, we present an original numerical study, varying the shape of a localised wrinkle and the effect this has on the strength of a curved laminate. This requires a high-fidelity mesh containing at least four layers of quadratic elements across each ply and interface layer, underlining the need for dune-composites, which can achieve run times of just over 2 min on 2048 cores for realistic composites problems with 173 million degrees of freedom.},

The effective elastic moduli of the material are thus derived. In particular, the method of asymptotic homogenization is used where a finite number of fibres are randomly distributed within the representative periodic cell. The study focuses on the efficacy of such an approach in representing a macroscopically random (hence transversely isotropic) material. Of particular importance is the sensitivity of the method to cell shape, and how this choice affects the resulting (configurationally averaged) elastic moduli. The averaging method is shown to yield results that lie within the Hashin–Shtrikman variational bounds for fibre-reinforced media and compares well with the multiple scattering and (classical) self-consistent approximations with a deviation from the latter in the larger volume fraction cases. Results also compare favourably with well-known experimental data from the literature.},

A concept of subset entropy is introduced in this work to quantify the subset image pattern quality for DIC analysis and its effectiveness was demonstrated by experimental studies. By employing white-light images with almost uniform subset entropy and first-order displacement functions, the effect of subset size on DIC analysis was investigated for the deformation cases of translation, uniform deformation, and simulated quadratic deformation, respectively. The results show that the chosen subset size must be large enough for precise displacement measurements when subset displacement functions match underlying actual deformation. On the other hand, optimal subset size in DIC for nonhomgeneous deformation measurements appears as a result of a tradeoff between the influence of random errors and systematic errors.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive overview is given in this book towards a fundamental understanding of the micromechanics of the overall response and failure modes of advanced materials, such as ceramics and ceramic and other composites. These advanced materials have become the focus of systematic and extensive research in recent times. The book consists of two parts. The first part reviews solids with microdefects such as cavities, cracks, and inclusions, as well as elastic composites. To render the book self-contained, the second part focuses on the fundamentals of continuum mechanics, particularly linear elasticity which forms the basis for the development of small deformation micromechanics. In Part 1, a fundamental and general framework for quantitative, rigorous analysis of the overall response and failure modes of microstructurally heterogeneous solids is systematically developed. These expressions apply to broad classes of materials with inhomogeneities and defects. While for the most part, the general framework is set within linear elasticity, the results directly translate to heterogeneous solids with rate-dependent or rate-independent inelastic constituents. This application is specifically referred to in various chapters. The general exact correlations obtained between the overall properties and the microstructure are then used together with simple models, to develop techniques for direct quantitative evaluation of the overall response which is generally described in terms of instantaneous overall moduli or compliance. The correlations among the corresponding results for a variety of problems are examined in great detail. The bounds as well as the specific results, include new observations and original developments, as well as an in-depth account of the state of the art. Part 2 focuses on Elasticity. The section on variational methods includes some new elements which should prove useful for application to advanced modeling, as well as solutions of composites and related heterogeneous bodies. A brief modern version of elements in vector and tensor algebra is provided which is particularly tailored to provide a background for the rest of this book. The data contained in this volume as Part 1 includes new results on many basic issues in micromechanics, which will be helpful to graduate students and researchers involved with rigorous physically-based modeling of overall properties of heterogeneous solids.  xx, 687 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.

The apparent IFSS in this glass-epoxy system was shown to be strongly dependent on the testing temperature and the matrix stoichiometry. High levels of cure shrinkage were measured in the IFSS microdroplets which resulted in internal stresses causing significant levels of droplet deformation.

The focus of the study is the effect of the proximity of the neighboring fibers on the ERR. For this, a hexagonal pattern of fibers in the composite cross-section is considered. Assuming one fiber to be debonded at certain initial debond arc-length, the effect of the closeness of the surrounding six fibers on the ERR of the crack is studied with the inter-fiber distance as a parameter. Using an embedded cell consisting of discrete fibers in a matrix surrounded by the homogenized composite, a finite element model and the virtual crack closure technique are used to calculate the ERR. Results show that the presence of the local fiber cluster accelerates the crack growth up to a certain initial crack angle, beyond which the opposite effect occurs. It is also found that the residual stress due to thermal cooldown reduces the ERR. However, the thermal cooldown is found to enhance the debond growth in plies within a cross-ply laminate.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents an investigation into the status of polymer composite failure theories. It provides a historical context for the origin of the study and also provides a detailed account of the methodology employed by the organizers to attain an impartial, independent, and broad ranging assessment of the leading failure theories. The study is known within the composites community as the “World-Wide Failure Exercise” (WWFE) and in some circles, the “Failure Olympics”. The origin of the WWFE can be traced to an “experts meeting” held at St Albans (UK) in 1991, on the subject of “Failure of Polymeric Composites and Structures: Mechanisms and Criteria for the Prediction of Performance”. The chapter includes a comprehensive description of the process by which the failure theories are selected, a brief description of the failure theories, the data and instructions supplied to the contributors, and the chronology of the key milestones. It evaluates the current level of maturity of theories for predicting the failure response of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) laminates, minimizing the knowledge gap between theoreticians and design practitioners in this field, and stimulating the composites community into providing design engineers with more robust and accurate failure prediction methods and the confidence to use them. The chapter compares the 19 theories featured within the study and the overall performance of the theories.},

The micro structure failure modes were estimated with the failure strength of constituents. A unidirectional composite plate with a circular hole in the center under two kinds of loads was analyzed with the traditional macro-mechanical failure analysis method and the unified macro- and micro-mechanics failure analysis method. The results obtained by the two methods are consistent, which show this new method’s accuracy and efficiency.},

In this study, a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model is developed to study numerically the energy release rate (ERR) by the J integral method. The simulation of a tensile test (in the direction of fiber) on a fibrous composite is performed using the damage model. The results obtained from the Integral Contour/Cohesive zone model are compared with those obtained previously and the results show a good agreement with the reference one obtained (J-integral and VCCT method). These analyses are studied according to several parameters such as: the debonding angles, the fiber volume fraction which is studied by varying distance between the broken fiber and the neighboring fibers, comparing two different representative volume elementary (RVE) (square and hexagonal motives). This study goes into the context and allows the analysis of the fiber/matrix interfacial crack behavior in a fiber micro-composite. The obtained results have demonstrated that the ERR and the intensity of the mechanical stresses depend not only on the level of the mechanical loading applied, but also on the angle of the debonding at the fiber/matrix interface.},

	abstract = {We introduce an adaptive concurrent multiscale methodology (ACM2) to handle situations in which both macroscopic and microscopic deformation fields strongly interact near the tip of a crack. The method is based on the balance between numerical and homogenization error; while the first type of error states that elements should be refined in regions of high deformation gradients, the second implies that element size may not be smaller than a threshold determined by the size of the unit cell representing the material’s microstructure. In this context, we build a finite element framework in which unit cells can be embedded in continuum region through appropriate macro-micro boundary coupling conditions. By combining the idea of adaptive refinement with the embedded unit cell technique, the methodology ensures that appropriate descriptions of the material are used adequately, regardless of the severity of deformations. We will then show that our computational technique, in conjunction with the extended finite element method, is ideal to study the strong interactions between a crack and the microstructure of heterogeneous media. In particular, it enables an explicit description of microstructural features near the crack tip, while a computationally inexpensive coarse scale continuum description is used in the rest of the domain. The paper presents several examples of crack propagation in materials with random microstructures and discuss the potential of the multiscale technique in relating microstructural details to material strength and toughness.},

The availability of data is generally low with only 11 available data sets ( 5.9 \%). The authors identified two main issues for the lacking availability of raw experimental data. First, the ability to retrieve data is strongly attached to the possibility to contact the corresponding author. This study suggests that institutional e-mail addresses are insufficient means for obtaining experimental data sets. Second, lack of experimental data is also due that submission and publication does not require to make the raw experimental data available. The following solutions are proposed: (1) Requirement of unique identifiers, like ORCID or ResearcherID, to detach the author(s) from their institutional e-mail address, (2) Provide DOIs, like Zenodo or Dataverse, to make raw experimental data citable, and (3) grant providing organizations should ensure that experimental data by public funded projects is available to the public.},

Since the manual approach completely depends on the specialist’s knowledge and experience, it lacks objectivity in the quantitative analysis. So, automatic image-based crack detection is proposed as a replacement. Literature presents different techniques to automatically identify the crack and its depth using image processing techniques. In this research, a detailed survey is conducted to identify the research challenges and the achievements till in this field. Accordingly, 50 research papers are taken related to crack detection, and those research papers are reviewed. Based on the review, analysis is provided based on the image processing techniques, objectives, accuracy level, error level, and the image data sets.

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being used in adaptive structures for sensing and actuation because of the large amount of deformation and force that these materials can produce upon heating. Of particular interest, is the bending actuation of polymers, such as polyurethanes, by embedding opposing SMA wires. Previous investigations on these structures have focused primarily on embedding single or opposing SMA wires that have been trained to exhibit the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the actuation behavior can be modeled and predicted. Alternatively, many potential adaptive structure applications can employ SMA wires exhibiting a one-way SME to eliminate the need for a priori two-way training of the SMA wires, and to increase the recoverable deformation in the structure. In this investigation, the repeatable bending actuation of polyurethanes using opposing one-way SMA wires exhibiting large deformation recovery is characterized with a full-field deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are analyzed with a one-dimensional actuation model previously proposed for predicting the bending actuation of elastomeric rods embedded with opposing two-way SMA wires. Using appropriate recovery strains and constitutive bending responses, this model was modified to characterize an `equivalent two-way SME' recovery strain for the one-way SMA wires. A kinematic model of the bending actuation is also presented that attributes the origin of the equivalent two-way SME to the biasing forces acting on the SMA wires. Repeatable bending actuation was achieved in polyurethanes using one-way SMA wires prestrained 5\% at an equivalent two-way SME recovery strain level of nearly 5\%. These results indicate that repeatable bending actuation can be achieved in polyurethanes by using opposing SMA wires exhibiting the one-way SME instead of the two-way SME at a level 25\% greater than reported for the two-way SME. The level of bending actuation will depend on the constraint of the SMA wires imposed by the stiffness of the polyurethane matrix. The symmetry of the bending actuation is affected by the symmetry of the local volume fraction of SMA wires and the symmetry of the prestrain levels in the wires. Furthermore, symmetric prestrain will enhance the level of equivalent two-way SME exhibited by the wires.},

	abstract = {The paper presents the results of an experimental work on the flexural behavior of three types of concrete: normal strength concrete (NSC), high strength concrete (HSC) and high strength fiber concrete (HSFC) in terms of crack detection, crack development, crack width measurements and strain components, using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. The experimental results of the present work and from others published in the literature were used to assess the accuracy of the major codes provisions (Eurocode 2, ACI 318 and the BS8110 code) for the crack width predictions. The comparison between the classical measurement techniques and the DIC technique suggests that both of them are suitable for the analysis of the strain components (deformations) of structural members. The most important additional benefit of the DIC technique is that it allows the easy detection of the first crack with a high precision, measures the crack opening and follows the progressive cracking process until failure of reinforced concrete members. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the addition of steel fibers increases the load at first crack and amplifies the number of cracks which leads to a remarkable decrease in both the crack spacing and crack width as well as an improvement of the ductility. The flexural failure of the beam specimens also changes from a brittle concrete crushing at the compression zone to a ductile and smooth concrete compression failure. Moreover, the present study shows that, at service load, the code’s provision on crack width are conservative for beams containing steel fibers since predicting excessively higher values than the experimental ones; the overestimation exceeded 300\% in some cases and none of the present major design codes takes into consideration the positive restraining effect of the fibers on the crack widening. The Rilem technical document appears to be the only one which takes account the positive effect of steel fibers on cracking, though still not accurate enough in predicting the crack width of fiber reinforced concrete. Based on the present experimental work and on data from the literature, a modification of the Rilem mathematical model is proposed with the aim of improving the crack width prediction of this challenging concrete material.},

In this design the wastes are first post-conditioned in a massive concrete structure called Supercontainer (SC) before being transported to an underground repository. The feasibility to construct this structure is being evaluated through a number of scaled models that are tested using various measurement techniques. This paper reports on the onset and evolution of the observed cracking of the concrete structure obtained by simultaneously applying Digital Image Correlation (DIC), Acoustic Emission (AE) and Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) nondestructive testing techniques. In particular, the results highlight the time of onset and location of crack initiation as well as the width and depth of the cracks.

	abstract = {The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. The Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the scientific method as "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses". Experiments are a procedure designed to test hypotheses. Experiments are an important tool of the scientific method. 
The method is a continuous process that begins with observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.
Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.
The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. Experiments can take place anywhere from a college lab to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order. Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method; they include physicist Lee Smolin and philosopher Paul Feyerabend (in his Against Method). Nola and Sankey remark that "For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year's debate".},

For the analysis of thermal cycling experimental results, an equivalent cycle time (ECT) was developed by applying degradation-reaction kinetic theories to thermal-cycling conditions. Applying this methodology to the weight loss measurements of composite specimens, thermal cycling was found to exhibit a slower weight-loss degradation rate than isothermal conditions. This observation seemed to result from a retarded diffusion rate of oxygen through the viscoelastic relaxation of the epoxy matrix exposed to the thermal cycling conditions. In the later stage of thermal cycling, the through-thickness microcracks were induced at the exposed surfaces and then propagated into the core of the composite laminates. Subsequently, the degradation rate measured by the composite weight loss was accelerated with the thermal cycles seemingly because themicrocracks increased the effective degradation-reaction area and enhanced the diffusion rate of oxygen into the unreacted core.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to characterize and compare damage processes in carbon/epoxy laminates submitted to either isothermal ageing or thermal cycling in neutral (vacuum or nitrogen) and oxidative (air) atmospheres. During a thermal cycling test performed in an oxidative atmosphere like air, there is a coupling effect between matrix oxidation, occurring at the highest temperatures of the cycle, and matrix cracking due to thermo-mechanical ply stresses induced by the prevented differential expansions of the plies. In order to separate those two damage mechanisms, a model of oxidation is used to determine the experimental conditions of an isothermal test ‘equivalent’ to a thermal cycling one, in terms of mass loss due to oxidation. After having checked this equivalence, a quantitative analysis of the damages induced by the two types of tests, is carried out. It is shown that the oxidation of a laminate in isothermal conditions results in damages, which concern only the skin of the sample. On the contrary, the coupling of such damage mechanisms with cyclic stresses in thermal cycling accelerates the damage processes and especially the matrix crack propagation from the surfaces to the core of the laminate.},

Samples which were subjected to thermal shocks from 650 °C to room temperature exhibited changes in Young’s modulus and internal friction with increasing number of shocks, indicating damage development in the form of creation of new internal surfaces. Fiber push-out tests showed that no significant changes in the properties of the fiber/matrix interface occurred, suggesting that damage in the composite was concentrated mainly in the development of matrix microcracking with less incidence of oxidation effects on the interface.

An original experimental approach combining three optical measurement techniques is presented. Image stereo-correlation and infrared thermography, that respectively provide the kinematic and thermal fields on the surface of the composites, are used in live recording during axis and off-axis tensile tests. Special attention is paid to simultaneously conduct these two techniques while avoiding their respective influence. On the other hand, X-ray tomography allows a post-failure analysis of the degradation patterns within the laminates volume. All these techniques are non-destructive (without contact) and offer an interesting full-field investigation of the material response. Their combination allows a coupled analysis of different demonstrations of same degradation mechanisms. For instance, thermal events and densimetric fields show a random location of damage in the early stages of testing. The influence of the material initial anisotropy on damage growth, localization and failure mode can also be clearly put in evidence through various data. In addition to such characterization, this study illustrates at the same time the capabilities of the different full-field techniques and the damage features they can best capture respectively.},

These experiments show that failure in tension occurs in several stages (similar to certain other brittle fiber composites): multiple matrix cracking, followed by fiber fracture and pullout. In flexural loading the failure process is more complex. Consequently, the flexural test cannot be used for measurement of tensile strength (although it can be used for measurement of the stress for matrix cracking). The application of conventional fracture mechanics to describe tensile failure is discussed. The in situ observations provide direct indication of the importance of frictional bonding between the matrix and fibers. Some novel methods for measuring the frictional forces and residual stresses are investigated, and the influence of surface damage on strength is assessed.},

A comparison between the model and experimental data is presented with the local temperature prediction that fits well with the experiments. An application is then proposed in the fourth part for properties prediction such as degree of cure, thermal and chemical strains, and shear modulus during the curing.

Nonlinear material behavior is incorporated through nonlocal continuum damage mechanics that preserves mesh objectivity in calculations that go beyond maximum loads. The integrated model is applied to the curing of plain weave textile composites made from carbon fiber tows and Epon ™ 862 resin. The mechanical and chemical properties are measured during curing using concurrent Brillouin and Raman light scattering. It is shown that significant stresses can develop during cure. The effect of these stresses on the manufactured part performance, when subsequent service loads are applied, is evaluated and a reduction in ultimate load, in agreement with experimental observations, is observed.},

	abstract = {A study of process-induced stress and deformation in thick-section thermosetting composite laminates is presented. A methodology is proposed for predict ing the evolution of residual stress development during the curing process. A one- dimensional cure simulation analysis is coupled to an incremental laminated plate theory model to study the relationships between complex gradients in temperature and degree of cure, and process-induced residual stress and deformation. Material models are proposed to describe the mechanical properties, thermal and chemical strains of the thermoset resin during cure. These material models are incorporated into a micromechanics model to pre dict the effective mechanical properties and process-induced strains of the composite dur ing cure. Thermal expansion and cure shrinkage contribute to changes in material specific volume and represent important sources of internal loading included in the analysis. Tem perature and degree of cure gradients that develop during the curing process represent fun damental mechanisms that contribute to stress development not considered in traditional residual stress analyses of laminated composites. Model predictions of cure dependent epoxy modulus and curvature in unsymmetric graphite/epoxy laminates are correlated with experimental data. The effects of processing history (autoclave temperature cure cy cle), laminate thickness, resin cure shrinkage and laminate stacking sequence on the evo lution of process-induced stress and deformation in thick-section glass/polyester and graphite/epoxy laminates during cure are studied. The magnitude of process-induced residual stress is sufficient to mitiate transverse cracks and delammations. The results clearly indicate that the mechanics and performance of thick-section thermoset laminates are strongly dependent on processing history.},

Thermo-mechanical analysis and tensile tests of the specimens were carried out to characterize the thermal and mechanical properties of MWCNTs/epoxy composites. Due to the negative thermal expansion and high modulus of MWCNTs, addition of MWCNTs resulted in a great reduction of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of epoxy. The MWCNTs also moderately increased the Young’s modulus of the epoxy. Then, the effects of adding MWCNTs on micro and macro-residual stresses in carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy laminated composites were investigated using the energy method and the classical lamination theory (CLT), respectively. The results indicated that the addition of low amounts of MWCNTs leads to a considerable reduction in thermal residual stress components in both micro and macro levels.},

The proposed method provides a simple means to combine traditional DIC approaches with peridynamics to achieve full-field displacements, even in the vicinity of cracks. In regions where DIC is accurate and effective, the displacement field is determined using a traditional approach. In discontinuous regions, the displacement field is solved for using peridynamics. This study shows that this method can be used successfully for investigating damage in materials such as nuclear graphite and fiber-RC (FRC). It also shows that the proposed method alleviates nonphysical strains in the vicinity of cracks, common to alternative approaches, which detrimentally degrade the quality of postprocessed quantities of interest such as fracture toughness.},

The first aim is to point out the ability of the mesoscopic phase-field method to make predictions of growth velocity at the nanoscopic length scale. Therefore the isothermal growth of a spherical crystalline cluster embedded in a melt is considered. We also show simulation techniques that enable to computationally bridge from the atomistic up to the mesoscopic scale. We use a PFM to simulate symmetric thermal dendrites started at an early stage of solidification related to nucleation. These techniques allow to simulate three dimensional dendrites from the state of nuclei (≈50 Å) converted from MD up to a size of some μm where ternary side-arms start to grow.},

The objective is to eliminate some misunderstandings and misconceptions regarding the peridynamic horizon.

	abstract = {Numerical studies on the failure of composites have mostly employed the finite element method. However, it can be rather challenging to predict failure using this method. The assumption of lamina homogeneity is questionable when predicting failure, though it is suitable for stress analysis. Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination are inherent to the inhomogeneous nature of the composite, thus the assumption of material homogeneity taints the failure prediction. It is, therefore, essential that the inhomogeneous nature of the composites must be retained in the analysis in order to predict the correct failure modes. Hence, this study considers distinct properties of the fiber and matrix and their volume fractions and fiber orientations while modeling composite laminates. The peridynamic theory is employed to predict the damage in center-cracked laminates with different fiber orientations. The predictions from the peridynamic analysis agree with the experimental observations published in the literature.},

The approach presented here provides the ability to model the macroscopic dynamics while at the same time resolving the dynamics at the length scales of the microstructure. Central to the methodology is a novel two-scale evolution equation. The rescaled solution of this equation is shown to provide a strong approximation to the actual deformation inside the peridynamic material. The two scale evolution can be split into a microscopic component tracking the dynamics at the length scale of the heterogeneities and a macroscopic component tracking the volume averaged (homogenized) dynamics. The interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic dynamics is given by a coupled system of evolution equations. The equations show that the forces generated by the homogenized deformation inside the medium are related to the homogenized deformation through a history dependent constitutive relation.},

This can lead to an inefficient design, because excess margins will exist for all properties except the one that determines the gauge. The design of a material can be made practical by creating a hybrid composite consisting of two or more types of fibers or resins, each embellishing a particular trait or function to the material. This paper investigates both high- and low-energy hail impact against a toughened-epoxy, intermediate-modulus, carbon-fiber composite using both experimental and analytical means. The effect of introducing ply-level hybridization by substituting up to 20\% of the plies with glass-reinforced plies is considered. It is found that delamination can be reduced by this hybridization, but the benefits are dependent on the impact energy and the test conditions. A computational model based on the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics is used to understand the benefits and trade-offs in hybridization.},

	abstract = {This is a brief survey of the scientific biography and works of George Rankine Irwin (born on February 26, 1907 in El Paso, Texas)—outstanding American scientist in the field of fracture mechanics and strength of materials, a Member of the American National Academy of Engineering, Royal Society of London, an Honorary Member and winner of prizes and awards of many American and European scientific societies. G. R. Irwin attended and graduated from Knox College and the University of Illinois where he won his Ph.D. degree. From 1936 till 1967, he worked in the US Naval Research Laboratory and in 1972, he became a Professor of Lehigh University and the University of Maryland where he now works. On the basis of his own experiments and the results of other researchers, G. R. Irwin suggested fundamentally new modification of the Griffith theory of brittle fracture and generalized this theory to the case of quasibrittle materials (see [2] and subsequent works). He introduced the concept of effective surface energy (1) and reformulated the Griffith theory in terms of singular stresses at the crack front and proved that his approach is equivalent to the Griffith energy approach [8]. He introduced stress intensity factors, i.e., parameters which relate the local mechanical state near the crack tip to macroscopic characteristics (such as the geometry of a body and loading) and enable one to give a very simple description of fracture processes as a continuous process of stable crack growth up to the onset of instability. His ideas very important for practical use and subsequent works devoted to their improvement and development caused a decisive influence on the progress in fracture mechanics as a new science and powerful engineering tool applicable to numerous problems connected with manufacturing and processing of materials and their failureproof operation in critical structures of various materials. By his works, Irwin initiated investigation of various aspects of the theory of fracture such as the role of plasticity, dynamics of the process, fractographic analysis of crack growth, etc. He also gave much attention to the development of new test methods for the determination of the characteristics of crackgrowth resistance of structural materials and their application. In recognition of Irwin's fundamental contribution to fracture mechanics, its fundamentals are now called the Griffith-Irwin theory (concept). A list of selected works by G. R. Irwin is given at the end of the present paper.},

The objective of the VAMAS coalition is to promote world trade in high technology areas which includes the assessment and development of test methods for advanced materials. In 1998, Technical Work Area 5, Polymer Composites, established a program to measure the fiber-matrix interfacial behavior with an initial focus on the single fiber fragmentation test (SFFT). The National Institute of Standards and Technology 9NIST), in dialogue with Michigan State University, developed a set of protocols for conducting the single fiber fragmentation test which included coupon size, coupon fabrication, testing parameters, data analysis, etc. Seven laboratories participated in the round robin with each laboratory supplied with 10 coupons to be tested in compliance with the NIST protocols. The results of the round robin found that five of the laboratories produced data that were in close agreement while two of the participating laboratories had results that were 20\% variant from the population mean. A review of the coupons returned by the two laboratories with the variant data showed that one laboratory incorrectly measured the critical length and the other laboratory incorrectly measured the fiber diameter. When corrected for these errors, the outlying data are shifted to be in statistical agreement with the population mean. The results of the round robin show that the fragmentation test generates a consistent measurement of the aspect ratio when the test is executed in accordance to test protocols.},

The mechanical characters of composite were described by bonds whose performance was depending on the distance and relative position of this couple of particles. In order to refine the description of composite’s anisotropy, the concept of transverse modulus in classic laminate theory was introduced into the definition of bonds. Peridynamic parameters such as micromodulus and critical stretch were established following the similar concepts in elasticity theory and mechanics of composite. In this peridynamic model three types of damages in composite laminate could be analyzed: fiber fracture, matrix fracture and delamination. The mesh independency was also examined for this approach. In the examples of laminate with unidirectional and multidirectional layup, the progressive damages and failure modes were successfully analyzed under a tensile load and had a good agreement with experiments. Moreover, much more details in the procedure of damage initiations and propagations, including fiber broken, matrix fracture and delamination, could be revealed. It had shown that this peridynamic model had a great potential for composite analysis.},

The effect of inertia is modeled using an explicit central difference scheme which is enhanced through the use of mass lumping, reduced integration with hourglass control, and numerical damping. The material nonlinearity and the flow stress dependency on strain rate, hardening and temperature are modeled with the Johnson–Cook visco-plastic model. The micro-void nucleation, growth and coalescence are modeled macroscopically with an isotropic damage model. The localization phenomenon due to the damage and thermal softening is suppressed by using the visco-plastic regularization in combination with the nonlocal visco-plastic model. The large deformation and large strain formulations are implemented within the X-FEM framework to model the macro crack discontinuities using an updated Lagrangian approach. Crack propagation and crack direction criteria are presented and the issues relating to the combination of X-FEM with the damage visco-plasticity model are addressed. Finally, the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified through several numerical examples.},

Because it is based on concepts not commonly used in the past, the purpose of this book is to explain the peridynamic theory in a single framework. It presents not only the theoretical basis but also its numerical implementation. The book begins with an overview of the peridynamic theory and derivation of its governing equations. The relationship between peridynamics and classical continuum mechanics is established, and this leads to the ordinary state-based peridynamics formulations for both isotropic and composite materials. Numerical treatments of the peridynamic equations are presented in detail along with solutions to many benchmark and demonstration problems. In order to take advantage of salient features of peridynamics and the finite element method, a coupling technique is also described. Finally, an extension of the peridynamic theory for thermal diffusion and fully coupled thermomechanics is presented with applications.--},

During the experiments, a high speed camera was used to determine deformation behavior. In both directions, modulus and failure strength increased with increasing strain rate. Higher strain rate sensitivity for both elastic modulus and failure strength was observed in the in-plane direction. Based upon these experimental data, a numerical model was developed using the commercial explicit finite element code LS-DYNA to investigate compressive deformation and damage behavior of composites. Excellent agreement was demonstrated for the case of high strain rate loading. Also, the fracture geometries were successfully predicted with the numerical model.},

	abstract = {Peridynamics is a recently developed theory of solid mechanics that replaces the partial differential equations of the classical continuum theory with integral equations. Since the integral equations remain valid in the presence of discontinuities such as cracks, the method has the potential to model fracture and damage with great generality and without the complications of mathematical singularities that plague conventional continuum approaches. Although a discretized form of the peridynamic integral equations has been implemented in a meshless code called EMU, the objective of the present paper is to describe how the peridynamic model can also be implemented in a conventional finite element analysis (FEA) code using truss elements. Since FEA is arguably the most widely used tool for structural analysis, this implementation may hasten the verification of peridynamics and significantly broaden the range of problems that the practicing analyst might attempt. Also, the present work demonstrates that different subregions of a model can be solved with either the classical partial differential equations or the peridynamic equations in the same calculation thus combining the efficiency of FEA with the generality of peridynamics. Several example problems show the equivalency of the FEA and the meshless peridynamic approach as well as demonstrate the utility and robustness of the method for problems involving fracture, damage and penetration.},

	abstract = {A direct computational approach for lifetime prediction of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is presented. The approach is based on a direct method which allows predicting the fatigue life from the stabilised damage state. The classical direct method is generalised to the case of coupled plasticity with damage mechanics of the UD-FRP composite materials [1]. The constitutive model is based on a continuous damage meso-scale approach [2]. By analysing damage variables and thermodynamical forces associated with damage at the stabilised state, fatigue life prediction law is proposed as a power law function of stabilised thermodynamic forces. The obtained numerical results have been validated by experimental test results on standard glass-fibre/epoxy angle-ply and cross-ply laminate plates. The proposed approach could serve as a useful tool for the design of FRP composites. (© 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

Owing to the linearity of the problem, the response to a point load can be used to obtain the response to general body force loading functions by superposition. Using Laplace and Fourier transforms, we thus obtain an integral representation for the three-dimensional peridynamic solution with the help of Green’s functions. We illustrate this new theoretical result by dynamic and static examples in one and three dimensions. In addition to this main result, we also derive the non-local three-dimensional jump conditions, as well as the weak formulation of peridynamics together with the associated finite element discretization.},

A monomeric and two polymeric coupling agents were applied via the electrodeposition (ED) and the dipping applications. A monomeric and a polymeric coupling agent showed significant and comparable improvements in interfacial shear strength (IFSS) compared to the untreated case under both tensile and compressive tests. Typical microfailure modes including cone-shaped fiber break, matrix cracking, and partial interlayer failure were observed under tension, whereas the diagonal slipped failure at both ends of the fractured fiber exhibited under compression. Adsorption and shear displacement mechanisms at the interface were described in terms of electrical attraction and primary and secondary bonding forces. For both the untreated and the treated cases AE distributions were separated well in tension, whereas AE distributions were rather closely overlapped in compression. It might be because of the difference in molecular failure energies and failure mechanisms between tension and compression. The maximum AE voltage for the waveform of either carbon or large-diameter basalt fiber breakages in tension exhibited much larger than that in compression. AE could provide more likely the quantitative information on the interfacial adhesion and microfailure.},

	abstract = {Existing failure criteria for isotropic bodies are reconsidered in this paper and compared with modern versions taking into account either the influence of the strength differential effect or the influence of the internal dilation of the materials on yielding and therefore the contribution of the hydrostatic component of stress in failure. Modern criteria are expressed by quadric polynomials whose coefficients constitute convenient terms of the failure tensor of the material which for the isotropic body is defined by the respective failure stresses in simple tension and compression.

Among the different expressions for the respective failure tensor polynomial of a material the paraboloid of revolution failure locus is the most convenient, since it fulfils the requirements of invariancy relative to any reference coordinate system, it is flexible and yields a unique solution for each loading path while it is unambiguously defined in the stress space. Furthermore, it is in conformity with basic physical laws and the extensive experience that the hydrostatic stress constitutes a safe loading path for the material.

Experimental evidence with all varieties of isotropic materials corroborates the theory upon which the criterion is based. Finally, a failure criterion, based on void coalescence mechanisms inside the material, which also takes into consideration the influence of internal dilation of the material and therefore it depends on the hydrostatic component of stresses, is presented. This criterion is an improvement of the Gurson-McClintock criterion which permits a judicial determination of the coefficients of the respective quadric polynomial expressing it, since it belongs to the broad family of criteria based on energy principles.},

The model can be used at a small scale, where the particles in the grain structure are generated and aggregate, matrix and bond properties are assigned to the lattice elements. Simulations at this scale are useful for studying the influence of material composition. In addition the model seems a promising tool for simulating fracture in structures. In this case the microstructure of the material is not mimicked in detail but rather the lattice elements are given tensile strengths which are randomly chosen out of a certain distribution. Realistic crack patterns are found compared with experiments on laboratory-scale specimens. The present results indicate that fracture mechanisms are simulated realistically. This is very important because it simplifies the tuning of the model.},

The mathematical description of a solid that follows from these assumptions relies on PDEs that additionally assume sufficient smoothness of the deformation for the PDEs to make sense in their either strong or weak forms. The classical theory has been demonstrated to provide a good approximation to the response of real materials down to small length scales, particularly in single crystals, provided these assumptions are met. Nevertheless, technology increasingly involves the design and fabrication of devices at smaller and smaller length scales, even interatomic dimensions.},

	abstract = {The parallel between the classical theory of elasticity and the modern physical theory of the solid state is incomplete; the former has nothing analogous to the concept of the force acting on an imperfection (dislocation, foreign atom, etc.) in a stressed crystal lattice. To remedy this a general theory of the forces on singularities in a Hookean elastic continuum is developed. The singularity is taken to be any state of internal stress satisfying the equilibrium equations but not the compatibility conditions. The force on a singularity can be given as an integral over a surface enclosing it. The integral contains the elastic field quantities which would surround the singularity in an infinite medium, multiplied by the difference between these quantities and those actually present. The expression for the force is thus of essentially the same form whether the force is due to applied surface tractions, other singularities or the presence of the free surface of the body ('image force'). A region of inhomogeneity in the elastic constants modifies the stress field; if it is mobile one can define and calculate the force on it. The total force on the singularities and inhomogeneities inside a surface can be expressed in terms of the integral of a 'Maxwell tensor of elasticity' taken over the surface. Possible extensions to the dynamical case are discussed.},

The surface displacement field is determined by using the digital image correlation method. Displacement gradients on the surface are computed after smoothing the displacement data. By performing a number of experiments and analyzing them, sources of errors in the system and their magnitudes are determined. Methods to minimize these errors are also discussed.

The main objective is to link specific AE parameters to the fracture mechanisms that are successively dominating the failure of this laminated material. At relatively low load, fracture is initiated by matrix cracking while, at the moment of peak load and thereafter, the fiber pull-out stage is reached. Stress modeling of the material under bending reveals that initiation of shear phenomena can also be activated depending on the shape (curvature) of the plate specimens. Preliminary results show that AE waveform parameters like frequency and energy are changing during loading, following the shift of fracturing mechanisms. Additionally, the AE behavior of specimens with different curvature is very indicative of the stress mode confirming the results of modeling. Moreover, AE source location shows the extent of the fracture process zone and its development in relation to the load. It is seen that AE monitoring yields valuable real time information on the fracture of the material and at the same time supplies valuable feedback to the stress modeling.},

This allows the interface to be subjected to various combinations of mode I and II loading, ranging from pure opening to pure shear. Hence it should be possible to obtain data characterising the resistance to interfacial debonding and disengagement over all of this range.

The effects of residual axial strain in the fiber and fiber surface topography were included. The residual axial strain was found to be a significant parameter. It is shown that the interface failure can be progressive or catastrophic. In the case of a progressive failure of the interface, the load-displacement curve is nonlinear. The portion of the curve from above the first nonlinearity to near the peak load can be predicted in terms of parameters of the interface, viz., the friction coefficient, the radial stress at the interface, the fracture toughness of the interface, and the residual axial strain in the fiber. Values for these parameters can be obtained from a single loaddeflection curve. The peak load and load drop, which are usually reported, are found not to be directly relatable to any interface property, since the length of the last portion of the fiber to debond is influenced by end effects and hence not easily predicted. However, for data which describe the peak load as a function of initial embedded length, that factor can be eliminated and the data reduced to yield the relevant interface parameters. In pullout, the peak and friction loads saturate with large specimen thickness. Catastrophic failure is favored when the debond initiation load is high or when residual stress is low. Finally, a methodology to extract interface parameters from experimental data is suggested.},

Results are presented for a series of sized glass fibres consisting of incompatible and compatible sizings, studied with a reacting vinyl ester matrix system. Surface free energy analysis was conducted to characterize the fibre surfaces. Axial and transverse wicking rates were measured to quantify the change in total surface free energy of the fibre/matrix systems.

	abstract = {An intensive study is carried out to investigate the veracity of an elasticity model called the axisymmetric damage model (ADM) to predict the micromechanical failure modes in a number of ideal unidirectional composites made from silicon carbide fibers and various glass matrices with uniform fiber spacing. In Part 1, the specimens contain two fiber coatings. Detailed experiments are conducted to study the fracture process by observation of surface cracking and through SEM micrographic analysis. Failure scenarios postulated through the ADM are consistent with the observed behavior using the measured constituent properties. Some of the features of the composites predicted in this work are: 1.
(1) Numerous matrix microcracks, approximately normal to and bridging the fibers, are observed. For the present materials, matrix crack initiation precedes the onset of nonlinearity of the composite stress-strain curve. A semiempirical model derived earlier and a mechanistic crack growth model are used to study this behavior.
2.
(2) Carbon mounds (or mountains), which are roughly triangular in cross-section and have a base width of approximately 5 μm, occur in the specimens. Their location displays a sensitive dependence on the properties of the glass matrix. The ADM suggests the origin of this phenomenon and the loading condition leading to it.
3.
(3) A massive degree of debonding is observed within the interfacial region. Again, the nature of this debonding is quite sensitive to the properties of the glass matrix, among other things. The model results are consistent with debonding initiated by radial tension and having continued growth under shear stress.
4.
(4) The progressive matrix cracking process is statistical in nature as the distance between successive microcracks varies considerably with position at their initiation. Calculation of the matrix stress field ahead of the interfacial debond leads to bounds, which surround the experimental observations, on the average spacing as a function of applied and residual stresses.
5.
(5) Multiple fiber breaks suggest stress transfer has taken place in some regions such that high values of the redistributed fiber axial stress have developed. It is inferred that such failures can only take place in regions where the interface is continuous, while the model results are consistent with the observed failure stress in the fibers.


We conclude with an evaluation of the quality of the model and the definition of future research and data needs required to further solidify our findings. We also offer some comments on the implications with regard to our understanding of the behavior of ceramic matrix composites. The well-controlled microgeometry of these composites and the overall consistency of their behavior with analytical models suggest that they can be regarded as truly pedigreed materials.},

	abstract = {The peridynamic theory is an alternative formulation of continuum mechanics oriented toward modeling discontinuites such as cracks. It differs from the classical theory and most nonlocal theories in that it does not involve spatial derivatives of the displacement field. Instead, it is formulated in terms of integral equations, whose validity is not affected by the presence of discontinuities such as cracks. It may be thought of as a “continuum version of molecular dynamics” in that particles interact directly with each other across a finite distance. This paper outlines the basis of the peridynamic theory and its numerical implementation in a three-dimensional code called EMU. Examples include simulations of a Charpy V-notch test, accumulated damage in concrete due to multiple impacts, and crack fragmentation of a glass plate.},

Asymmetries in the order of terms in computing the nodal forces lead to different round-off errors for symmetric nodes about the pre-crack line. This induces the observed slight asymmetries in the branched crack paths. A dramatically enhanced crack-path instability and asymmetry of the branching pattern are obtained when we use fracture energy values that change with the local damage. The peridynamic model used here captures well the experimentally observed successive branching events and secondary cracking. Secondary cracks form as a direct consequence of wave propagation and reflection from the boundaries.},

With this model we analyze the dynamic effects induced by different types of dynamic loading on the fracture and damage behavior of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites. In contrast to the results expected from quasi-static loading, the simulations show that dynamic conditions can lead to co-existence of and transitions between fracture modes; matrix shattering can happen before a splitting crack propagates. We observe matrix–fiber splitting fracture, matrix cracking, and crack migration in the matrix, including crack branching in the matrix similar to what is observed in recent dynamic experiments. The new model works for arbitrary fiber orientation relative to a uniform discretization grid and also works with random discretizations. The peridynamic composite model captures significant differences in the crack propagation behavior when dynamic loadings of different intensities are applied. An interesting result is branching of a splitting crack into two matrix cracks in transversely loaded samples. These cracks branch as in an isotropic material but here they migrate over the “fiber bonds”, without breaking them. This behavior has been observed in recent experiments. The strong influence that elastic waves have on the matrix damage and crack propagation paths is discussed. No special criteria for splitting mode fracture (Mode II), crack curving, or crack arrest are needed, and yet we obtain all these modes of material failure as a direct result of the peridynamic simulations.},

This model enables predicting complex fracture phenomena such as spontaneous crack nucleation and crack branching, curving and arrest, a capability inherited from the bond-based peridynamic theory. An important feature of the model is that the bond properties, i.e. the stiffness constant and critical stretch, are continuous functions of bond orientation in the principal material axes. This facilitates fracture analysis of anisotropic materials with random orientations, such as polycrystalline microstructures. Elastic and fracture behaviour of the model has been verified through simulating uniaxial tension of a composite plate and fracture of a cortical bone compact tension specimen, and making quantitative comparisons to analytical and experimental data. To further demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model, dynamic fracture of a polycrystalline microstructure (alumina ceramic) has been simulated. The influence of the grain boundary and grain interior fracture energies on the interacting and competing fracture modes of polycrystalline materials, i.e. intergranular and transgranular fracture, has been studied.},

	abstract = {Under transverse tensile loading, fibers oriented perpendicular to the tensile direction can undergo fiber/matrix debonding. Experiments show that the first stage of fiber/matrix interface debonding is mode-I dominated fracture with very fast crack growth rate. Subsequent stable crack propagation along the interface is due to mixed mode I/II fracture. The aim of this study is to explore ways to stabilize the early stage of debonding so that it becomes possible to determine the mixed mode interfacial fracture properties for the entire mode-mixity range by in-situ observations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to stabilize crack initiation in the dominant mode-I fracture by changing the position of one fiber with its neighboring fiber or hole using the finite element analysis. The progressive fiber/matrix debonding is studied by focusing on the interaction of one fiber with its neighboring fiber or hole. The results show that decrease of the position angle stabilize the crack growth at the interface in the ligaments. This effect is more significant in the cases with small ligament thickness. In the two-fiber model and at very small ligaments the results show that the crack growth stops when the crack tips meet each other in the ligament and further crack growth is under dominant mode-II fracture. In the fiber-hole model, both the crack initiation and propagation are stabilized by decrease of the position angles at very thin ligaments. This paper suggests to use two fibers instead of a single fiber in order to ease the characterization of interfacial properties.},

The data obtained were used to identify the modes of damage and its effects on the macroscopic behaviour of the composite material under both static and fatigue loading. Then, a fatigue model was used to predict the fatigue life of the composite under tension-tension cyclic tests. This model reduces drastically the number of fatigue tests required to obtain S-N curves.

The resulting stress and strain fields that consequently develop in the materials composing the engineering structures are complex with multiple non-zero stress and strain tensor components. The life prediction of a composite material in the presence of such complicated stress fields is a very demanding task since a number of different factors must be taken into account. The experimental characterization of composite systems under irregular loading patterns is another delicate matter, hindering the possibility of developing methods based solely on experimental results and therefore making theoretical modeling procedures indispensable. Several methods have been introduced for the life prediction of composite materials under such loading conditions. A brief review is presented in this chapter, while a classic fatigue design methodology is analytically presented and applied to the available variable amplitude fatigue data from Chap. 2 in order to demonstrate its applicability to the selected cases.},

	abstract = {The static and fatigue behaviors of composite laminates depend on the applied loading and the resulting stress state. Simple and fast uniaxial experiments can characterize the material under such loading. However, the situation is much more complicated when complex stress states develop in the material. The setting up and realization of multiaxial experimental programs are complicated and the results not very reliable. Therefore, it is necessary to establish methods that can simulate the multiaxial fatigue behavior of composite laminates and estimate their fatigue life under complex stress states. This chapter focuses on the presentation of available macroscopic fatigue failure theories that take into account the synergistic effect of all stress tensor components on the strength and fatigue life of the examined material. A comparison of the predictive ability of the examined fatigue theories is also presented based on data from Chap. 2, and other data found in the literature.},

	abstract = {The fatigue behavior of fiber-reinforced composite materials under constant amplitude and variable amplitude loading depends on the type of material and a number of loading parameters. This chapter presents the concepts and theoretical formulations used in order to model the fatigue behavior of fiber-reinforced composite materials, independent of their nature. The commonly used S–N curve types are presented and their applicability to the examined material system dataset is evaluated. Curves estimated by novel computational methods are also presented and compared to traditional ones. The concept of the constant life diagrams (CLDs) used for the quantification of the effect of the mean cyclic stress on the fatigue life of the examined materials is also described. The commonly used CLDs and those most recently introduced are methodically presented. Their performance is evaluated based on their ability to predict S–N curves under “unseen” loading conditions, covering all possible R-ratios of tension-tension, tension-compression and compression-compression fatigue. An alternative approach for the modeling of the fatigue behavior of composite materials under constant amplitude loading is also introduced in this chapter. This approach, according to which stiffness is conceived as the damage metric, whose degradation dominates the fatigue behavior of the material, is based on stiffness degradation measurements during the fatigue life of the examined material. When a certain stiffness limit is reached, the material is considered as having failed. Use of stiffness degradation as a measure for the modeling of the constant amplitude fatigue life of the examined material leads to the derivation of S–N curves corresponding to a predefined level of stiffness degradation and not to ultimate material failure.},

The first step in modeling composite mechanical properties is the generation of a representative volume element (RVE) which accurately describes the distinctive microstructure of the material. Injection molded short steel fiber composites exhibit a complex microstructure due to the three-dimensional orientation, waviness and entanglements of the fibers. The present work proposes a data structure for description of the RVE geometry and algorithms for RVE random generation. The micro-structure of short steel fiber reinforced polycarbonate samples was determined using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and the model input parameters were identified using a specialized image processing methodology, based on the Mimics software package. Model generated RVEs were satisfactory compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively against the real micro-CT reconstructed volumes.},

The solution satisfies equilibrium and compatibility every place and satisfies most boundary conditions exactly. The only approximation is that the axial stress in the fiber at a fiber break is equal to zero in an averaged sense instead of exactly. Two important advantages of the analysis are that it can handle anisotropic fibers and it can include imperfect interfaces or interphases. Theoretical predictions of stress transfer were compared to experimental Raman spectroscopy results. The results agreed well and were used to measure interface properties. The strain energy was integrated to get total strain energy in a fiber/matrix fragment. It is proposed that this result will be useful for developing fracture mechanics models of the fragmentation test.},

	abstract = {A new experimental strategy for in situ measurement of the fiber/matrix interface strength is presented. As-fabricated graphite/epoxy laminates with specially designed grooved islands on their front surfaces were loaded on their rear sides by a 16 to 20 ns long laser-generated pressure pulse. This compressive stress pulse, generated in-line on the rear of one of the surface islands, propagates normal to the plane of the laminate and very quickly attains a steady-state profile of approximately 130 μm after undergoing multiple scattering from individual fibers and laminates. The returning tensile wave from the sample's free surface prises the composite island off by nucleating a subsurface crack. This crack on the local scale comprises several fiber/matrix interface debonds connected by the intervening matrix. The free-surface velocity causing this damage is recorded by interferometry and related to the far-field composite-scale tensile stress by using a one-dimensional elasto-dynamic analysis. The local fiber/matrix interface stress concentration corresponding to this overall tensile stress was determined next by using a finite-element simulation that idealized the fiber distribution within the epoxy matrix to be periodic. The interface tensile strength was taken as the sum of this stress and the compressive residual stress at the same location, which in turn, was estimated by yet another analysis based on the finite-element procedure. For a graphite/epoxy laminate fabricated from a unidirectional Hercules AS4 graphite fiber tapes pre-impregnated with 450 k cure Hercules 3502 thermosetting epoxy resin, an average fiber/matrix interface strength of 210 MPa was estimated.},

Varying the 90 ° ply thickness, it is possible to assess its effect on the mechanical response of laminated composites — the in situ effect. The proposed framework is able to accurately represent the micro-mechanical response of ultra-low grades, including (i) the mechanics of transverse cracking onset and propagation, (ii) the constraining effect observed in the laminae embedded in multidirectional laminates, (iii) the gradual, slow stress relaxation and progressive transverse cracking observed in very thin plies, and consequent increase of the crack density, (iv) the reduction in crack-opening displacement of the transverse cracks with ply thinness, (v) the formation of thin necks of matrix material around the regions where interfacial damage is more pronounced, and (vi) the in situ strengths.},

The composite behavior was also simulated through computational micromechanics, which was able to account for the effect of the constituent properties (fiber, matrix and interface) on the macroscopic shear response. The influence of matrix, fiber and interface properties on each region and on the overall composite behavior was assessed from the experimental results and the numerical simulations. After the initial elastic region, the shear behavior presented two different regions, the first one controlled by matrix yielding and the second one by the elastic deformation of the fibers.

This paper investigates the use of acoustic emission (AE) to locate and classify the type of damage occurring in a composite, carbon fibre panel during buckling. The damage was first located using a bespoke location algorithm developed at Cardiff University, called delta-T mapping. Signals identified as coming from the regions of damage were then analysed using three AE classification techniques; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis, Unsupervised Waveform Clustering (UWC) and corrected Measured Amplitude Ratio (MAR). A comparison of results yielded by these techniques shows a strong agreement regarding the nature of the damage present in the panel, with the signals assigned to two different damage mechanisms, believed to be delamination and matrix cracking. Ultrasonic C-scan images and a digital image correlation (DIC) analysis of the buckled panel were used as validation. MAR’s ability to reveal the orientation of recorded signals greatly assisted the identification of the delamination region, however, ANN and UWC have the ability to group signals into several different classes, which would prove useful in instances where several damage mechanisms were generated. Combining each technique’s individual merits in a multi-technique analysis dramatically improved the reliability of the AE investigation and it is thought that this cross-correlation between techniques will also be the key to developing a reliable SHM system.},

The effect of material properties on the maximum shear stress during the load transfer is investigated. The results indicate an optimum point where the shear stress would be the lowest at the interphase. With the help of this model, the effect of crack initiation at the interphase on the stresses is illustrated.

In this paper detailed calculations are presented for this effect. The mechanical behavior of the interphase between fibers and matrix is modelled by continuity of tractions and a linear relation between displacement differences across the interphase and the conjugate tractions. The proportionality constants characterize the stiffness and the strength of the interphase. For a cell of the composite which contains a cluster of fibers, calculations have been carried out by the use of the boundary element method. Four cases have been considered: (1) perfect composite. (2) a single fiber in the composite with lower interphase stiffness, (3) a single fiber in the composite with interphase cracks and lower interphase stiffness, and (4) a missing fiber in the composite. The interface stresses for neighboring fibers have been calculated. Also, for the case of the fiber with an interphase crack the strain energy density near the crack tip has been calculated and the condition for crack propagation has been discussed.},

The examination of the extreme value distribution of the inclusions located at the site of fatigue crack nucleation on the fracture surface of the fatigue test bars is compared with the extreme value distribution of the inclusions found on polished specimen. The extreme value distribution of the non-metallic inclusions is used to predict the theoretical lower fatigue limit of the steel. The experimental part of the paper consists of the fatigue testing of 61 test bars that were taken from a process industry forged steel roll. The estimation and comparison of the fatigue limit and its deviation was done using the least squares and binomial analysis methods. The results from this analysis are compared with the theoretically predicted upper and lower fatigue limit. The fatigue tests show that the fatigue test bars orientated tangentially to the axis of the forged steel roll have significantly lower fatigue lives when compared to the fatigue lives of the test specimens orientated along the axial direction of the forged steel roll.},

The fatigue behavior can be divided into three categories:(a)
The S–N curve displays a continuous decline and the internal cracks initiated from the large oxide inclusions for commercial 50CrV4 steel in which the average inclusion size is about 29 μm.
(b)
Step-wise S–N curves were observed for clean 54SiCrV6 and clean 50CrV4 steels in which the average inclusion sizes are about 3.0 and 2.4 μm respectively. Most fatigue failures originated from the VC inclusion clusters at the lower stress amplitudes.
(c)
For clean 54SiCr6 steel in which the inclusion size is smaller than 1 μm, the fatigue cracks did not initiated from inclusions or inclusion clusters but from the region enriched with carbon. S–N curve shows that the fatigue failure hardly occurs from 106 to 109 cycles, in other words, the fatigue reliability can be substantially improved in the super long fatigue life regime.},

For this purpose ultrasonic tension–compression fatigue tests (R = −1) with the bainitic high-strength steel 100Cr6 (SAE 52100) were carried out until an ultimate number of cycles of 109. Additionally, runout specimens were tested repeatedly with higher stress amplitudes until failure occurred. By this method threshold values for the stress intensity factors in the very high cycle fatigue regime were found to be dependent on the inclusion type. So beside the threshold value for crack propagation of long cracks inside a fish-eye, Kth, another threshold value can be found for the formation of the so called fine granular area which is characteristic for very high cycle fatigue failure. This threshold value, below which no initiation in form of a fine granular area can be observed, is further dependent on the chemical composition of the crack initiating inclusion. Thus, a true fatigue limit in the very high cycle fatigue regime depends on the inclusion size and inclusion type. Further the inclusion type with the lowest threshold value indicates an absolute threshold value for very high cycle fatigue crack initiation due to the formation of the fine granular area.},

	abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world and steel reinforcement is always required to meet tensile strength and ductility demands of concrete structures. The production of concrete and reinforced concrete structures creates lots of environmental issues associated with the significant release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In addition, the corrosion of steel reinforcement is one of the major challenges that current civil engineers are facing. In the United States, the upgrading of civil infrastructure due to steel corrosion has been estimated as several trillion dollars. Thus, it is urgent to promote sustainable concrete and structures to reduce their negative impact on the environment.

The development of new environmentally friendly materials to replace steel rebar as reinforcement for concrete structure is a significant step to achieve sustainable concrete and structures. In this chapter, two types of sustainable concrete structures considering the use of natural fibres as reinforcement of concrete and concrete structures were introduced, i.e. Coir Fibre Reinforced Concrete (CFRC) mortar-free structures and Flax Fibre Reinforced Polymer tube encased Coir Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FFRP-CFRC) composite structures. The static and dynamic properties of these structures were studied.

It was found that natural fibres in different configurations can be used to replace conventional steel rebar as reinforcement of concrete structures. In addition, both sustainable concrete structures show good potential to be used in earthquake-prone zones. The application of these sustainable concrete structures is beneficial for consuming less energy, releasing less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and costing less to build and to maintain over time.},

The results show that the razor blade tapping method produces a lowest critical stress intensity factor, K lc, while the razor blade pressing produces an abnormally high K lc, being about five times higher than the former for the pure epoxy. Transmission polarized optical microscopy reveals that the crack tip produced by razor blade pressing in the pure epoxy specimen was completely surrounded by a plastic deformation zone with compressive residual stress, but the crack tip produced by razor blade tapping was free of residual stress and plastic deformation. It was found that the sensitivity of the fracture toughness value to the pre-cracking methods decreases after the pure epoxy was modified by 10\% core-shell rubber or 10\% liquid rubber.},

For this, a suitable approach is the crack front perturbation method initiated by Rice (1985). It allows to update the stress intensity factors (SIFs) when the crack front of a planar crack is perturbed in its plane. This approach and its later extensions to more complex cases are recalled in this review. Applications concerning the deformation of the crack front when it propagates quasistatically in a homogeneous or heterogeneous media have been considered in brittle fracture, fatigue or subcritical propagation. The crack shapes corresponding to uniform SIF have been derived: cracks with straight or circular fronts, but also when bifurcations exist, with wavy front. For an initial straight crack, it has been shown that, in homogeneous media, in the quasistatic case, perturbations of all lengthscales progressively disappear unless disordered fracture properties yields Family and Vicsek (1985) roughness of the crack front. Extension of those perturbation approaches to more realistic geometries and to coalescence of cracks is also envisaged.},

In this work, we establish the expression of the variation of the mode I stress intensity factor up to second order in the perturbation, in the specific case of a semi-infinite tensile crack embedded in some infinite body. The treatment is basically simple and uses earlier results of Rice [34]. Formulae are given in both the physical space and Fourier’s space. They differ from earlier ones established by Adda-Bedia et al. [1] for the same problem, using a more complex method of solution. Finite element computations performed for sinusoidal perturbations support the new formulae, rather than the older ones. As an application, it is finally shown that the mean value of the energy-release-rate along the front of a perturbed semi-infinite tensile crack is exactly the same, up to second order in the perturbation, as if the front were straight.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper (Leblond et al., 2012), we established, using some results of Rice (1989), the second-order expression of the variation of the mode I stress intensity factor resulting from some small, but otherwise arbitrary coplanar perturbation of the front of a semi-infinite tensile crack in an infinite body. The aim of the present work is to apply the expression found to a geometrically nonlinear analysis of quasistatic, coplanar crack propagation in some heterogeneous medium. In a first step, we recall Leblond et al. (2012)’s formula, extending it to the case where the unperturbed stress intensity factor, for the straight configuration of the front, depends on the position of this front; in addition to being intrinsically interesting, such an extension is necessary in order to avoid meaningless divergent integrals in what follows. In a second step, assuming the local energy-release-rate to be equal everywhere on the crack front to its critical value, we derive an expression of the shape of this front accurate to second order in the fluctuations of toughness of the material. In a third step, as an application, we present a second-order calculation of the equilibrium shape of the crack front, when it penetrates a single infinitely elongated obstacle or a periodic distribution of such obstacles. Special attention is paid to the case, of particular physical interest, where the derivative of the unperturbed stress intensity factor with respect to the position of the crack front can be neglected.},

	abstract = {By quantitative stimulation of the vagus nerves of isolated rabbit atria frequency-response relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect (reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential) and the inotropic response. An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the frequency-response characteristic to the right. At higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible. By raising the concentration up to 4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies. In the range of 20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to the right. The time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period. A mathematical handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres.},

Around 21–30\% improvement on the interfacial shear strength was obtained after addition of 2 up to 14 vol.\% silica nanoparticles inside matrices. The improved matrix shear yield stress and interfacial bonding were believed to be the driving force. Moreover, the stress transfer mechanisms of the composites exhibited a dependence on the applied strain level. At lower strain level, the systems filled with silica performed similar behavior to neat epoxy matrix, in which nearly no enhancement on the interfacial shear stress was observed due to the pre-existed thermal compressive stress acting on fibers. However, at larger strain level applied, the higher shear yield stress and better interfacial bonding due to the existence of rigid silica nanoparticles made the stress transferring more efficiently than neat matrix at the circumstance of partial- or total-debonded interface.},

The indentation analysis considers three separate corrections to the well-known Oliver and Pharr method: (i) overestimation of the projected contact area due to sample curvature, (ii) overestimation of projected contact area due to substrate curvature, and (iii) underestimation of fiber stiffness due to the structural compliance of the sample. The method is applied to four types of high performance ballistic fibers: KM2 Plus, Twaron, AuTx, and Dyneema; the results are presented according to both the modified analyses as well as the standard Oliver and Pharr analysis. The modified analyses resulted in an increase in the elastic modulus and hardness of up to 35 and 60\%, respectively, compared to the Oliver–Pharr method. The technique has the potential to be applied to single microfilaments under various environmental conditions that may otherwise be compromised by traditional fiber mounting methods.},

	abstract = {Digital Image Correlation algorithms capable of determining continuous displacement fields are receiving growing attention in the field of mechanical properties identification. In this paper, we develop an Improved Spectral Approach (ISA) to reconstruct continuous displacements based on their Fourier decomposition. This approach leads to a time and memory-efficient algorithm, thanks to the fast Fourier transform. Moreover, the Fourier-based decomposition enables accurate heterogeneous measurements. Improvements consist in increasing the accuracy and convergence rate as well as dealing with non-periodic displacements and images. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is presented to quantify the noise sensitivity of the ISA from which useful information is retrieved. The approach is evaluated using synthetic images deformed by heterogeneous displacement fields. Comparisons show that the introduced modifications lead to lower uncertainties by one order of magnitude in the case of non-periodic images and displacement field studied. Moreover, first-order (SO1) and second-order (SO2) subset-based Digital Image Correlation algorithms are compared with the ISA. The comparisons herein reveal that the uncertainties of the ISA are 6–9 times smaller than those of the SO1 due to insufficiency of the first-order shape function for the estimation of heterogeneous displacements, while being slightly smaller than those of the SO2. Moreover, as the image smoothness decreases, the uncertainties of the SO2 deviate from those of the ISA and the exact displacements. The presented approach shows great potentials for challenging applications such as strain measurements at microstructural levels.},

For each indenter type, different values of the sharpness of the indenter are considered and two rates of indentation are analyzed. Significant sink-in is found to occur in all cases considered. The amount of sink-in is found to be smaller for sharper indenters. The calculated values of both the nominal and true hardness do not differ significantly for the two indenter shapes. An expanding spherical cavity model is also considered and the predictions of this model are compared with the finite element results for various indenter shapes and indentation rates.

Firstly, an efficient testing concept was developed at BAM. In this framework, the geometry for a modified single edge notched tensile specimen (SET) was developed in order to assure appropriate resolution in measuring the crack length via a CCD-camera [3].

Liquid carboxyl-terminated acrylonitrile-butadiene (CTBN) and silicon (SI) rubber dispersions were used as tougheners for the EP. The morphology of the modified EP was characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The fracture toughness, Kc, of the compositions decreased with increasing deformation rate. Kc of the EP was slightly improved by CTBN addition and practically unaffected by incorporation of the SI dispersion when tests were performed at low cross-head speed, v. Both modifiers improved Kc at high v, and also the resistance to FCP, by shifting the curves to higher stress intensity factor ranges, ΔK, by comparison with the plain EP. It was established that both fracture and fatigue performance rely on the compliance, JR, at the rubbery plateau, and thus on the apparent molecular mass between crosslinks, Mc. The failure mechanisms were less dependent upon the loading mode (fracture, fatigue), but differed basically for the various modifiers. Rubber-induced cavitation and shear yielding of the EP were dominant for CTBN, whereas crack bifurcation and branching controlled the cracking in SI-modified EP. The simultaneous use of both modifiers resulted in a synergistic effect for both the fracture toughness at high deformation rate and the FCP behavior.},

A representative unit cell (RUC) of a single NCF lamina with fibre crimp has been developed following this approach. The RUC has been used to predict the stiffness properties and to study the stresses/strains that develop along the length of the tows. To ensure the validity of the new modelling approach, the results obtained with its use have been compared with the results obtained from an equivalent RUC in which the FE mesh follows the actual curvature of the tows, in accordance with the classical modelling approach. The results show that the new approach is a valid alternative to model the waviness of the fibres, both in terms of simplicity in modelling and accuracy of the results, opening up the possibility of studying damage mechanisms more efficiently.},

	abstract = {Nanoindentation is employed to determine the flow stress of a pure aluminium matrix of a composite reinforced with continuous alumina fibres. The stress for a given representative strain, which depends on the geometry of the indenter, can be deduced using the reverse method established by Bucaille et al. [Acta Mater. 51 (2003) 1663] assuming that the normal force is proportional to the square of the penetration depth: F=Ch2. During the first stage of this work, nanoindentation experiments were conducted on annealed and cold-worked aluminium using the Berkovich and cube corner pyramids. The apparent hardness of these materials was found to decrease with increasing penetration depth. The evolution of the normal force as a function of penetration depth was therefore modelled by a polynomial equation allowing extrapolation of the mechanical behaviour to the macroscopic scale. Good agreement was found between the flow stress of cold-worked aluminium obtained in this manner and the values obtained from tensile testing. However, for the annealed aluminium, the present method largely overestimates the values. It is suggested that both geometrically necessary dislocations and the microstructure are the main factors responsible for the indentation size effect (ISE). Several scales must therefore be considered in order to extrapolate the behaviour of aluminium from the nano- to the macroscale. In the second stage of this work, nanoindentation tests were carried out in the aluminium matrix of the composite at small penetration depths to avoid any influence of the fibres. By comparison with previous results on bulk aluminium, the flow stress of the matrix was determined and its plastic behaviour was found to be close to that of cold-worked aluminium, in agreement with other studies. This implies that the aluminium matrix is strongly modified by the presence of fibres during the fabrication of the composite.},

	abstract = {Fiber dimensions and lignin and cellulose content of various highly productive, non-wood plants and agricultural residues were examined to assess their suitability for paper production. Plants like kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) and giant reed (Arundo donax L.) internodes gave very good derived values, especially slenderness ratio, which is directly comparable to some softwood and most hardwood species. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) stalks, miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) have shorter fibers resulting to poorer flexibility and Runkel ratios, but still satisfactory slenderness ratios. Finally, fibers from olive tree (Olea europea L.) and almond tree (Prunus dulcis L.) prunings presented relatively short and thick fibers producing the poorest derived values among all the species examined. Fiber dimensions did not differ significantly within each species, when samples from different stalks/branches or different positions (base, middle top) were examined. The only exception were cotton stalks, where those differences did not have any significant effect on fiber derived values.
Chemical analysis of the raw plant materials revealed satisfactory levels of α-cellulose content (close to 40\%) and Klason lignin content ({\textless}30\%) compared to those of hardwoods and softwoods. Relatively increased ({\textgreater}25\%) lignin content in miscanthus, switchgrass and almond prunings may require additional pulping time and chemical charge compared to those of other non-wood raw materials. Analysis of samples at various heights/lengths of the plant materials showed that lignin and cellulose content depends on tissue maturity, but does not change significantly within each species.},

Based on the 3D solution, the dilute solution-based homogeneous model is adopted for the carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced nanocomposite considering FGVI and effective fibre modulus, in which the van der Waals-based cohesive law is adopted for the connection between CNT and the interphase. Parametric studies demonstrate that: (1) FGVI increases the composite stiffness, while it leads to the earlier debonding of the cohesive interface. (2) The peak strength of the macroscopic stress–strain is greatly influenced by the cohesive strength at the interface, higher cohesive strength leads to higher macroscopic peak strength. (3) The peak strength of the macroscopic stress–strain relation is underestimated without considering the effective fibre modulus, and the influence of the effective FGVI modulus is larger than that of the effective fibre. (4) CNTs of the large diameter bring the stress drop at a very small strain, especially for the large volume fraction of CNT.},

The interface is modelled on a nano(metre)-scale and the aim is to investigate its local influence on the ultimate macroscopic transverse properties. Fibre-to-matrix stress transfer (i.e. fibre-to-matrix surface interaction) is simulated by introducing elastic interface springs. Since these elastic springs represent the chemical (covalent) bonds formed at the interface as a result of oxidative chemical surface treatment, the micromechanical model can be directly related to the effects of this treatment. For the verification of the numerical analyses, the influence of the interface is determined experimentally by transverse testing of carbon fibre reinforced composites, using fibres that were subjected to different levels of surface treatment. A direct relation between the oxygen concentration on the surface of the fibres, the interfacial bond strength and the resulting transverse strength was found. The interface strength required to obtain perfect bonding was found to be dependent on the fibre volume fraction and at increased fibre volume fractions a higher level of adhesion is required.},

	abstract = {The plane strain problem of a single circular cylindrical inclusion embedded in an unbounded matrix subjected to a remote uniform uniaxial transverse tension is studied. A theoretical model for the simultaneous prediction of the initial size of a crack originated at the inclusion/matrix interface (or equivalently the initial polar angle of this crack) and of the critical remote tension required to originate this crack is developed. Isotropic and linear elastic behaviour of both materials, with the inclusion being stiffer than the matrix, is assumed. The interface is considered to be strong (providing continuity of displacements and tractions across the interface surface) and brittle. The model developed is based on the classical analytic solutions for the above-mentioned inclusion problem without and with a crack situated at the inclusion/matrix interface and a recently introduced coupled stress and energy criterion of failure by Leguillon [Eur. J. Mech. A/Solids 21 (2002) 61–72]. A new dimensionless structural parameter γγ, depending on bimaterial and interface properties together with the inclusion radius a, which plays a key role in characterizing the interface crack onset, is introduced. Asymptotic behaviour of the predicted critical remote tension and the interface crack length/polar angle at the onset are characterized for small and large values of γγ and a. A size effect inherent to this problem is predicted and analysed. The following asymptotic characteristics of this size effect are noteworthy: (i) for small inclusion radii a, the polar angle of the crack at onset is constant (independent of a), whereas the critical remote tension increases with decreasing a, being inversely proportional to the square root of a; (ii) for large inclusion radii a, the length of the crack at onset and the critical remote tension are approximately constant.},

In particular, this work is focused on the tension dominated failure. After an abrupt onset the crack grows unstably up to achieving an arrest length. A simple plane strain model of a single circular inclusion surrounded by an unbounded matrix allows obtaining conclusions approximately valid for a dilute fibre packing. Linear isotropic elastic behaviour is assumed for both inclusion and matrix. Two classical elastic solutions for both perfectly bonded and partially debonded circular inclusions are used together with a coupled stress and energy criterion, proposed recently in the framework of finite fracture mechanics, and a phenomenological law for fracture toughness of interface cracks growing in fracture mixed mode. The obtained analytical and semi-analytical expressions make easy studying the influence of all the dimensionless parameters governing the fibre–matrix system behaviour: Dundurs elastic bimaterial constants αα and ββ, the interface brittleness number γγ and the load biaxiality parameter ηη. A size effect of the inclusion radius on the critical load is predicted, smaller inclusions being stronger and less dependent on the secondary load. Finally, an experimental procedure for measurement of the fibre–matrix interface fracture and strength properties is proposed.},

	abstract = {The level of fiber–matrix interfacial adhesion in composites is traditionally evaluated by means of a stress-based parameter. Recently, it was suggested that an interfacial energy parameter might constitute a valid alternative. From an overview of the literature regarding the single-fiber composite fragmentation test, it appears that energy-based approaches have already been proposed in the past, but were either not successful, or not fully developed. Our recent energy balance scheme, proposed for the analysis of the initial interface debonding which occurs at fiber breaks during a fragmentation test, is presented and expanded here. The effects of thermal residual stress in the fiber, and of friction in the debonded area, are now incorporated in the energy balance model. We use a different shear-lag parameter proposed by Nayfeh, rather than the commonly used Cox parameter. New, extensive single-fiber fragmentation data regarding the interface crack initiation regime is presented, using sized and unsized E-glass fibers embedded in UV-curable or epoxy polymers. Some data for unsized carbon in epoxy is also presented. Fiber fragmentation is forced to take place entirely in the linear elastic region of the stress–strain curve, by means of pre-stressed single fibers. The importance of this procedure is discussed. Future work will focus on the interface crack propagation regime.},

Both models predict a strong nonlinear dependence of the critical load on the fiber size. A good agreement between the predictions provided by these models is found for large and medium fiber radii. However, different scaling laws for small fiber radii are noticed. A discussion of the asymptotic trends for very small and very large fiber radii is presented. Limitations of both models are also discussed. For very small fibers, it is shown that matrix plasticity can prevail over fiber–matrix debonding, leading to an upper bound for the critical load. When fiber–matrix debonding prevails over plasticity for large enough fibers, the predictions provided by the two models are still in fair good agreement.},

During testing, damage was detected using both visual observation under polarized light and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Separation of failure mechanisms, based on AE events, was performed using time domain parameters (amplitude and event width) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency spectra of the AE waveforms. The latter can be considered as a fingerprint allowing to discriminate fibre failure, matrix cracking, fibre–matrix interface debonding, friction and ‘parasite noise’. Stresses in the specimens were evaluated using a two-dimensional finite element model (FEM) and monochromatic photoelasticity was used to verify the simulated stress distribution.
Two failure mechanisms appeared to be in competition in the Broutman test: fibre failure under compressive stresses and fibre–matrix interface debonding under transverse tensile stresses. For systems in which the interfacial adhesion is not so ‘good’, like glass fibre–polyester systems for instance, fibre–matrix debonding was observed, and the progression of the debonding front with the interfacial transverse stress was recorded. Thermal stresses are also discussed, and a FEM simulation shows that they encourage fibre failure under compressive stresses.},

Individual specimens were inspected using X-ray Computed Tomography and only the specimens with acceptable quality pin insertions were tested experimentally under a range of mode mixities. Two stacking sequences, uni-directional (UD) and quasi-isotropic (QI) were investigated. It was found that the pins inside the UD samples experienced significantly larger pin/matrix bond strength than those in the QI laminates. The resulting experimental data indicates that a non-UD laminate type may experience pin pull-out and thus increased energy absorption for a wider range of mode mixities than a UD laminate type. Energy plots show a clear transition from a pull-out to a pin rupture region for both laminate types. Specimens that experienced pin rupture during low mode mixity tests exhibited similar failure energies to those loaded in pure mode II.},

	abstract = {An experimental method to determine the complete stress versus deformation relation for a thin adhesive layer loaded in shear is presented. The method is based on a classic specimen geometry; the end-notch flexure specimen. The experiments are evaluated using an inverse method. First, the variation of the energy release rate with respect to the shear deformation at the crack tip is measured during an experiment. Then the traction–deformation relation is derived using an inverse method. The theory is based on the path-independence of the J-integral and considers the effects of a flexible adhesive layer.
Quasi-static experiments on three different specimen geometries are performed using a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The experiments give consistent results. This shows that the traction–deformation relation can be taken as independent of the dimensions of the adherends. Thus, the constitutive relation can be considered as a property of the adhesive layer. The deformation process at the crack tip is also monitored during the experiments by the use of a digital camera attached to a microscope.},

This study is concerned with an improved Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) for accurate identification of mechanical properties of composite materials components from full-field measured displacement data. This numerical–analytical approach, namely Regularized Model Updating (RMU), is developed based on a hybrid constrained optimization algorithm. For this purpose, mechanical constraints, consisting of an appropriate homogenization model, are added as regularization factors to the optimization algorithm. The proposed method is validated by conducting several virtual experiments through elastic constitutive parameters identification of 2D composites. The sensitivity of the developed algorithm to different levels of noises of measured displacement fields is investigated. The identification results indicate that the proposed RMU methodology leads to higher accuracy of mechanical properties in comparison with FEMU method, particularly in the presence of random noise.},

	abstract = {Thanks to its ability to non-destructively access internal strains in materials, Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) is gaining growing interest from both experimental and theoretical mechanics communities. One important issue in the implementation of DVC is the considerable computational costs associated with the huge amount of data, which hinders the applications of the technique, especially for high-resolution displacement and strain measurements. In this paper, we propose an accurate global DVC approach based on a Fourier decomposition for the kinematic basis of the sought displacement field. The approach, referred to as IS-DVC, leads to an algorithm whose computational complexity is not considerably increased by increasing the number of Degrees of Freedom (DOF) of the kinematic basis, thus being computationally efficient using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Artificial experiments have been used to evaluate the uncertainties of IS-DVC at high resolutions. Especially, displacement fields of 3D composites with spherical and non-aligned ellipsoidal particles at small scales were reconstructed. Resulting measurements revealed close similarities in terms of strain heterogeneities throughout the volume with the benchmark strains. Furthermore, it was shown that, in the presence of a discontinuity, the measurement uncertainties are not significantly affected, except for regions surrounding the discontinuity, hence validating the robustness of the reconstructed displacement field at a large number of DOF.},

	abstract = {Experimental investigations of adhesive joints and fibre composites have shown that under Mode II cracking, the fracture process induces a displacement normal to the fracture plane. This effect can be attributed e.g. to roughness of the fracture surface under dominating tangential crack face displacements. As the crack faces displace relatively to each other, the roughness asperities ride on top of each other and result in an opening (dilatation) in the normal direction. Furthermore, the interaction of the crack surfaces in the contact zone gives rise to compressive normal stresses and frictional shear stresses opposing the crack face displacements. A phenomenological Mixed Mode cohesive zone law, derived from a potential function, is developed to describe the above mentioned fracture behaviour under monotonic opening. The interface dilatation introduces two new lengths. The cohesive law is implemented in the commercial finite element program Abaqus. The model is validated and tested against experimental results under various mode mixities.},

	abstract = {Under loads normal to the direction of the fibers, composites suffer failures that are known as matrix or interfiber failures, typically involving interface cracks between matrix and fibers, the coalescence of which originates macrocracks in the composite. The purpose of this paper is to develop a micromechanical model, using the boundary element method, to generate information aiming to explain and support the mechanism of appearance and propagation of the damage. To this end, a single fiber surrounded by the matrix and with a partial debonding is studied. It has been found that under uniaxial loading transversal to the fibers direction the most significant phenomena appear for semidebonding angles in the interval between 60deg and 70deg. After this interval the growth of the crack along the interface is stable (energy release rate (ERR) decreasing) in pure Mode II, whereas it is plausibly unstable in mixed mode (dominated by Mode I for semidebondings smaller than 30deg) until it reaches the interval. At this interval the direction of maximum circumferential stress at the neighborhood of the crack tip is approximately normal to the applied load. If a crack corresponding to a debonding in this interval leaves the interface and penetrates into the matrix then: (a) the growth through the matrix is unstable in pure Mode I; (b) the value of the ERR reaches a maximum (in comparison with other debonding angles); and (c) the ERR is greater than that released if the crack continued growing along the interface. All this suggests that it is in this interval of semidebondings (60–70deg) that conditions are most appropriate for an interface crack to kink. Experiments developed by the authors show an excellent agreement between the predictions generated in this paper and the evolution of the damage in an actual composite.},

A colloidal system containing mechanically milled titanium nanopowder, bicine, and water was developed for use as a DIC tracking pattern that is stable at 795°C. The resultant full-field strain maps provide a constituent level characterization of damage evolution from crack initiation through final fracture. An analysis of strain along fiber lengths indicated that fiber mean strain and standard deviation reached a minimum at fiber fracture. In addition, multiple matrix cracks in the process zone ahead of a notch/crack tip were apparent and could falsely appear as a continuous region of high strain in DIC fields. Relatively large displacement (strain) error was attributed to noise and bias at these small length scales and small strain values, and approaches for mitigating this error are discussed.},

The interfacial shear strength of PE-sisal composites was measured using the single fibre fragmentation test (SFFT). The difficulties in obtaining significant measurements are discussed and assessed. The main problems found were the non-transparent nature of the matrix, the irregular shape of the fibres, and the variability in fibre–matrix adhesion encountered even in single fibre specimens. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) pictures obtained from fractured surfaces were used for a qualitative evaluation of the interfacial properties of NFRTPs. Fibre treatment with stearic acid increased the interfacial shear strength by 23\% with respect to untreated fibres. The improvements in interfacial shear strength found for the treated specimens were consistent with observations from SEM fractographs.},

	abstract = {Understanding damage and failure of composite materials is critical for reliable and cost-effective engineering design. Bringing together materials mechanics and modeling, this book provides a complete guide to damage, fatigue and failure of composite materials. Early chapters focus on the underlying principles governing composite damage, reviewing basic equations and mechanics theory, before describing mechanisms of damage such as cracking, breakage and buckling. In subsequent chapters, the physical mechanisms underlying the formation and progression of damage under mechanical loads are described with ample experimental data, and micro- and macro-level damage models are combined. Finally, fatigue of composite materials is discussed using fatigue-life diagrams. While there is a special emphasis on polymer matrix composites, metal and ceramic matrix composites are also described. Outlining methods for more reliable design of composite structures, this is a valuable resource for engineers and materials scientists in industry and academia.},

Working with such model composites has obvious advantages, such as the full control of experimental parameters, the possibility of introducing perturbative effects in a controlled way, and the possibility of verifying theoretical models in the range of low fiber content. Indeed, macroscopic composite materials contain various types of defects and perturbative effects, such as fiber misalignment or slack, fiber-poor regions, voids, etc., which bias any quantitative assessment of mechanical and physical properties, and preclude the accurate verification of theoretical schemes. One difficulty in working with microcomposite models, also recalled here, is the need for an appropriate “scaling-up” procedure to the level of macroscopic composites.},

The novelty of this work is to compare three different simulation methods for the composite Carbon/PPS by suggesting a 2D programing simulation approach that would reduce the calculation time of the elastic behaviour of the yarn of woven composite material. To conduct the work an experimental analysis was planned to identify the micro geometric parameters of the composite and to collect all needed dimensions for building the numerical models. The simulation procedures are carried out through three different micro-scale methods and by applying two different finite element approaches: 3D periodic approach, 3D random approach and 2D random approach, the results show that the Young modulus presents a differentiation reach 12\% and the Shear Modules G13 and G12 is roughly 11\% and 29.39\% for G23. The micro mechanical results are discussed according to the recent literature investigations. The numerical results from the proposed approaches are discussed, which show good agreement with reality of the material when using the random 3D approach and very good gain of time of simulation when using the 2D programing simulation approach. This approach reduces the calculation time about 50\% compared with other methods.},

The tensile tests were performed under an optical microscope to give sufficient precision, and a numerical model was developed. The experimental results showed high heterogeneities in strain fields which increase with the applied stress level. The comparison with the underlying microstructure and the numerical model enabled us to study the influence of the yarn on the mechanical behaviour.

	abstract = {Cure residual stress and its effect on damage in unidirectional fibre-reinforced polymer–matrix composites under transverse loading were studied using a micromechanical unit cell model and the finite element method. The overall residual stress introduced from curing was determined by considering two contributions: volume shrinkage of matrix resin from the crosslink polymerization during isothermal curing and thermal contraction of both resin and fibre as a result of cooling from the curing temperature to room temperature. To examine the effect of residual stress on failure, a model based on the Maximum Principal Stress criterion and stiffness degradation technique was used for damage analysis of the unit cell subjected to mechanical loading after curing. Predicted damage initiation and evolution are clearly influenced by the inclusion of residual stress. Residual stress is always detrimental for transverse compressive loading and pure shear loading. For transverse tensile loading, residual stress is detrimental for relatively low resin strength and beneficial for relatively high resin strength. Failure envelopes were obtained for both biaxial normal loading and combined shear and normal loading and the results show that residual stress results in a shifting and contraction of the failure envelopes.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a fabrication method that enables creation of structures from digital models. Among the different structures fabricated by 3D printing methods, helical microstructures attracted the attention of the researchers due to their potential in different fields such as MEMS, lab-on-a-chip systems, microelectronics and telecommunications. Here we review different types of 3D printing methods capable of fabricating 3D freeform helical microstructures. The techniques including two more common microfabrication methods (i.e., focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography) and also five methods based on computer-controlled robotic direct deposition of ink filament (i.e., fused deposition modeling, meniscus-confined electrodeposition, conformal printing on a rotating mandrel, UV-assisted and solvent-cast 3D printings) and their advantages and disadvantages regarding their utilization for the fabrication of helical microstructures are discussed. Focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography techniques enable the fabrication of very precise shapes with a resolution down to ∼100 nm. However, these techniques may have material constraints (e.g., low viscosity) and/or may need special process conditions (e.g., vacuum chamber) and expensive equipment. The five other techniques based on robotic extrusion of materials through a nozzle are relatively cost-effective, however show lower resolution and less precise features. The popular fused deposition modeling method offers a wide variety of printable materials but the helical microstructures manufactured featured a less precise geometry compared to the other printing methods discussed in this review. The UV-assisted and the solvent-cast 3D printing methods both demonstrated high performance for the printing of 3D freeform structures such as the helix shape. However, the compatible materials used in these methods were limited to UV-curable polymers and polylactic acid (PLA), respectively. Meniscus-confined electrodeposition is a flexible, low cost technique that is capable of fabricating 3D structures both in nano- and microscales including freeform helical microstructures (down to few microns) under room conditions using metals. However, the metals suitable for this technique are limited to those that can be electrochemically deposited with the use of an electrolyte solution. The highest precision on the helix geometry was achieved using the conformal printing on a rotating mandrel. This method offers the lowest shape deformation after printing but requires more tools (e.g., mandrel, motor) and the printed structure must be separated from the mandrel. Helical microstructures made of multifunctional materials (e.g., carbon nanotube nanocomposites, metallic coated polymer template) were used in different technological applications such as strain/load sensors, cell separators and micro-antennas. These innovative 3D microsystems exploiting the unique helix shape demonstrated their potential for better performance and more compact microsystems.},

The technique combines the measurement of local deformations during tests in a scanning electron microscope and numerical simulations, in which the measurements are used as boundary conditions. Deformations are measured by placing a grid of markers on the surface of a single fibre specimen. The displacements of these markers are measured during loading of the specimen. Numerical simulations show that the radial and tangential interface stresses increase towards the specimen surface, causing the initiation of debonding at the surface. This effect is supported by tests under an optical microscope. The INS is defined to be the maximum radial interface stress just before the initiation of debonding. The INS values are determined for carbon fibres with surface treatment levels varying from 0\% to 100\% commercial treatment level. The results show an increasing INS for increasing treatment level. Based on the presented results, it can be concluded that the presented technique can be used for the measurement of the interfacial normal stress.},

After loading the specimen until the first fiber fracture and instantaneous debonding events occur, the specimen is unloaded and loaded again until the debond propagates. The critical load for debond propagation is measured and is used with a fracture mechanics analysis to determine the interface fracture toughness. The analysis considers also friction between the fiber and matrix in the debonded region. To obtain the necessary data for calculation of residual radial stress at the F/M interface due to matrix cure shrinkage, simultaneous measurements of dynamic modulus and cure shrinkage were conducted on the matrix (vinylester) during cure. Tests employing E-glass/vinylester SFFT specimens provided fracture toughness values of Gcd = 62 J/m2 (frictionless) and 48 J/m2 (friction).},

Specimens had cylindrical debond cracks of known dimensions created in fragmentation tests. Mechanisms for debond growth were described for two materials where the difference was in glass fibre surface treatment. As the debonds reached a critical size in the arc (circumferential) direction, unstable debond growth occurred in the fibre direction. The debond angle at instability was fairly similar for both materials, although the material based on glass fibre treated with a coupling agent reached twice as high stress before instability.},

Based on the complex variable method of Muskhelishvili, closed-form solutions for the stresses and the displacements around the crack are obtained when general biaxial loads are applied at infinity. These solutions are then combined with A.A. Griffith's virtual work argument to give a criterion of crack extension, namely the de-bonding of the interface. The critical applied loads are expressed explicitly in terms of a function of the inclusion radius and the central angle subtended by the crack arc. In the case of simple tension the critical load is inversely proportional to the square-root of the inclusion radius. By analyzing the variation of the cleavage stress near the crack tip, the deviation of the crack into the matrix is discussed. The case of uniaxial tension is worked out in detail.},

There is ample experimental evidence that cracks in brittle, isotropic, homogeneous materials propagate such that pure mode I conditions are maintained at the crack tip. An unloaded crack subsequently subject to a combination of modes I and II will initiate growth by kinking in such a direction that the advancing tip is in mode I. The chapter also elaborates some of the basic results on the characterization of crack tip fields and on the specification of interface toughness. The competition between crack advance within the interface and kinking out of the interface depends on the relative toughness of the interface to that of the adjoining material. The interface stress intensity factors play precisely the same role as their counterparts in elastic fracture mechanics for homogeneous, isotropic solids. When an interface between a bimaterial system is actually a very thin layer of a third phase, the details of the cracking morphology in the thin interface layer can also play a role in determining the mixed mode toughness. The elasticity solutions for cracks in multilayers are also elaborated.},

	abstract = {The reasons for our interest in the interface are reviewed, and bond-strength sensitive properties are discussed. It is shown that the four direct methods currently used for interface measurement have problems that make their results inconsistent between methods and inaccurate. The failure process has been monitored in glass/epoxy pull-out specimens with very short fibre free lengths, so that crack propagation is stable. This showed that, close to ultimate failure, a very small length of the interface was carrying nearly all the (very high) load. This apparently high interfacial shear strength can be explained on the basis of the recently documented lack of a shear failure mode for most polymers. All four interface tests are centro-symmetric, or nearly so. In this situation, a matrix that cannot fail in shear, must fail in tension. Yet tensile failure is strongly inhibited by the centro-symmetry. Hence shear failure is forced at the interface itself by a tensile-type process. This involves tensile pulling of the polymer over the high points on the fibre. (No surface is perfectly smooth.) The result is thus unduly influenced by the surface roughness of the fibre and the shrinkage pressure, neither of which are directly related to adhesion. Although great progress has been made with fracture analysis of interface failure, this cannot resolve the problem of the unrealistic centro-symmetry of the tests. It is, therefore, recommended instead that direct tests on composites be examined for relevance and usefulness. The most useful method may well be to measure the off-axis tensile strength of unidirectional composites. This has been shown to be more sensitive to interface properties than both the fragmentation test and the pull-out test. Single-fibre tests and fracture analyses of these tests should be used only for basic research into centro-symmetric failure modes.},

Model unidirectional carbon–carbon composites were prepared using the same type of fibre and different pitches as matrix precursors. These included both commercial pitches and synthesized in the laboratory ones. The chemical composition of the matrix precursor determined the type of microstructure developed in the composite, this microstructure seems to govern the fibre-matrix bonding and in turn controls the fracture behaviour of the composite. In general, a matrix texture of mosaic (small size) seems to yield a good fibre-matrix bonding, making the materials to have higher interlaminar shear strength but having at the same time brittle fracture behaviour. On the other hand, composites where larger textures were developed in the matrix seem to have a poorer fibre-matrix bonding. This made the composites to have lower strength, but it allowed debonding of fibre and matrix during fracture. As a result, these materials showed pseudo-plastic failure behaviour. Other examples of both types of fracture behaviour associated with the change in microstructure and fibre–matrix interface are discussed.},

These unique properties of the polymer have encouraged many mechanistic and physical examinations of the processes involved in the friction and wear of this polymer. A section of such work carried out over the past 30 years is reviewed here. When rubbed against a hard surface, the PTFE chain undergoes scission, creating active groups which chemically react with the counterface. This results in strong adhesion and a coherent transfer film. Further interaction between the bulk polymer and the transfer film gives rise to anisotropic deformation of the unit cell, which results in closeness of adjacent chains and easy shear between chains. Sliding brings about growth in as well as reorientation of crystallites situated in a very thin subsurface region of the bulk polymer. Such structural rearrangement facilitates the joining of adjacent aligned crystallites to form films and ribbons which emerge as debris.},

In the current study we explore an alternative approach to deliver CNTs to the fiber surface by dispersing CNTs in the fiber sizing formulation. This route takes advantage of the developed techniques for CNT dispersion in resins and introduces no damage to the fibers. We focus on unidirectional glass fiber/epoxy macro-composites where CNTs are introduced in three ways: (1) in the fiber sizing, (2) in the matrix and (3) in the fiber sizing and matrix simultaneously. Interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is investigated using single-fiber push-out microindentation. The results of the test reveal an increase of IFSS in all three cases. The maximum gain (over 90\%) is achieved in the composite where CNTs are introduced solely in the fiber sizing.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) microperiodic scaffolds of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) have been fabricated by direct-write assembly of a photopolymerizable hydrogel ink. The ink is initially composed of physically entangled pHEMA chains dissolved in a solution of HEMA monomer, comonomer, photoinitiator and water. Upon printing 3D scaffolds of varying architecture, the ink filaments are exposed to UV light, where they are transformed into an interpenetrating hydrogel network of chemically cross-linked and physically entangled pHEMA chains. These 3D microperiodic scaffolds are rendered growth compliant for primary rat hippocampal neurons by absorption of polylysine. Neuronal cells thrive on these scaffolds, forming differentiated, intricately branched networks. Confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals that both cell distribution and extent of neuronal process alignment depend upon scaffold architecture. This work provides an important step forward in the creation of suitable platforms for in vitro study of sensitive cell types.},

While further applications are eagerly awaited, progress has been impeded by a lack of appropriate processing methods. Our group attempted to construct a novel three-dimensional microfabrication system for the free processing of three-dimensional micro-level forms. The system processed the polymers with extremely high precision using a fine nozzle. An evaluation of one of the piled-up layers of the extruded lines revealed lateral and depth resolutions of 40 µm and 45 µm, respectively. Micro-pipes, micro-bends and micro-coil springs were fabricated in less than 15 min by stacking up melted polymers from a nozzle. A batch process was adopted for the supply of the materials in order to eliminate the use of toxic solvents, one of the necessary evils with earlier fabrication techniques. Microstructures fabricated by our system and by a conventional method were tested in tensile strength tests to compare the mechanical strengths. The biocompatibility of a newly fabricated structure was tested by cultivating a cell line (PC12) in a small poly(lactic acid) (PLA) vessel with a transparent base, then comparing the morphology and growth with those of the same PC12 line cultivated by a standard vessel.},

	abstract = {Solvent-cast printing is a highly versatile microfabrication technique that can be used to construct various geometries such as filaments, towers, scaffolds, and freeform circular spirals by the robotic deposition of a polymer solution ink onto a moving stage. In this work, we have performed a comprehensive characterization of the solvent-cast printing process using polylactide (PLA) solutions by analyzing the flow behavior of the solutions, the solvent evaporation kinetics, and the effect of process-related parameters on the crystallization of the extruded filaments. Rotational rheometry at low to moderate shear rates showed a nearly Newtonian behavior of the PLA solutions, while capillary flow analysis based on process-related data indicated shear thinning at high shear rates. Solvent vaporization tests suggested that the internal diffusion of the solvent through the filaments controlled the solvent removal of the extrudates. Different kinds of three-dimensional (3D) structures including a layer-by-layer tower, nine-layer scaffold, and freeform spiral were fabricated, and a processing map was given to show the proper ranges of process-related parameters (i.e., polymer content, applied pressure, nozzle diameter, and robot velocity) for the different geometries. The results of differential scanning calorimetry revealed that slow solvent evaporation could increase the ability of PLA to complete its crystallization process during the filament drying stage. The method developed here offers a new perspective for manufacturing complex structures from polymer solutions and provides guidelines to optimize the various parameters for 3D geometry fabrication.},

The model only slightly overestimated the composite failure strain, but predictions of fibre break density were too high, which can be mainly attributed to errors in the Weibull distribution. Both the number and percentage of interacting fibre break clusters were under-predicted by the model. This was attributed to an underestimation of stress concentrations in the model. While the experimental observations revealed mainly co-planar clusters, the model predicted mainly diffuse clusters. The experiments showed that the clusters did grow any further after their formation, while the model predicted a gradual development. Both local and dynamic stress concentrations were hypothesised to be key features for further exploration. The discrepancies identified, inform suggestions for directions advancing the state-of-the-art strength models of UD composites.},

	abstract = {Many criteria have historically been proposed to predict failures in composites. Some of them were quasi-mimetically taken from metallic materials failure criteria and others were inspired by observation of the appearance of the failure of the composites. Prediction of the failure of the matrix (also called inter-fibre failure) has traditionally been assigned to a certain interaction (typically quadratic) between the components of the stress vector associated to the plane of failure. In this paper, a revision of these proposals is first of all carried out in order to examine in greater depth the implications of some of them. Then, a micromechanical study is conducted considering, based on failure observations, that the mechanism of failure starts with a crack running between the fibre and the matrix. The objective of this micromechanical analysis is to elucidate whether the assumption that the stress vector associated to a plane controls the failure of the plane is physically based. The numerical analysis is performed using the Boundary Element Method, allowing contact between the debonded surfaces of fibre and matrix. Different combinations of loads are applied (perpendicular and parallel to the plane of failure) to check their influence in the energy release rate, which is the fracture parameter evaluated. The results obtained prove numerically that stresses not associated to the macromechanical plane of failure play an important role in the micromechanism of failure of fibrous composites. This fact has been experimentally checked by means of the performance of a series of two dimensional loading tests.},

In practice, while preferring glass woven fabric layers in fabrication, to achieve the required design strength, the nominal size of the component was increased. This increased the total weight of the component. In the present work, glass laminate is strengthened and stiffened by interplying high modulus carbon fabric layers for attaining better specific properties. Two symmetrical four layered glass/carbon hybrid laminates and two dedicated four layered glass or carbon laminates were fabricated separately using the hand lay up and compression moulding techniques. The static mechanical properties like tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength and dynamic mechanical properties such as storage modulus, loss modulus and loss factor of these laminates were experimentally evaluated as per ASTM standards and reported. The influence of stacking sequence of composite laminates on static and dynamic mechanical properties was discussed in detail. The modulus curves of dedicated and hybrid composite laminates in a Cole-Cole plot show an imperfect semi-circular curve indicating the heterogeneity of the laminates and relatively good fibre/matrix bonding. A conclusion as to the superiority of one of the hybrid constructions for structural applications could also be reached.},

A comparison of the matrix crack development throughout both types of tests has been undertaken: they have been found analogous, but with very far much faster kinetics under thermal cycling. Moreover, the fatigue test frequency has a significant influence on crack onset and development. However, it seems that the parameters ‘time’ and ‘transverse ply stress amplitude’ are not sufficient to completely explain the very fast cracking kinetics observed under thermal cycling.},

	abstract = {In this study, the thermo-mechanical performance of flax fibre reinforced poly lactic acid (PLA) biocomposites was investigated for the potential use in load bearing application such as body-in-white and body structures in the automotive sector. Focus was given into the relationships between the thermal and mechanical properties, and the material response under different loading and environmental conditions. The strength (72 MPa) and stiffness (13 GPa) of flax/PLA composites investigated indicate a very promising material to replace traditional choices in load bearing application. The PLA’s crystallinity was measured to approximately 27\%. Annealing above 100 °C for an hour decreased that value to 30\%, but analysis of tensile results of annealed specimens reveals a significant reduction of both the tensile strength and modulus. This reduction is associated with micro-cracking that occurred on the surface of PLA during the heating as well as deterioration of the flax properties due to drying. The study results show that strength and modulus increased with increasing strain rates, while elongation at break reduces respectively. A modulus of 22 GPa was recorded in 4.2 m/s crosshead velocity. Further, flax/PLA showed significantly higher modulus than flax/epoxy for the composites studied. Improvement of the interfacial bonding and the temperature characteristics, combined the thermoplastic nature of PLA, demonstrates that flax/PLA composites is ideal for use in structural automotive applications.},

	abstract = {Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites are increasingly applied in aircraft structures. These high-performance thermoplastic matrices need processing at high temperatures; therefore, thermal residual stresses arise due to the mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion between the fibres and the thermoplastic matrix. Since residual stresses are inherently present in virtually all composite materials and influence the properties of the composite structures significantly, it is of utmost importance that the residual thermal stresses are taken into account in both design and analytic modelling of composite structures. In order to understand the effects of residual stresses and find ways to decrease their magnitude or use them to our advantage, the factors responsible for the residual stress build-up need to be understood. This first part of a literature review discusses these factors, focusing on thermoplastic composites, and in particular the material properties of their constituents and processing parameters governing stress build-up.},

These specimens were subjected to a low velocity impact of 1.5 m/s with an incident impact energy of 2.17 J using an instrumented drop weight impact tester at three different temperatures of 30 °C, 50 °C and 65 °C. The residual flexural strength of the post impacted specimens were measured by the conduction of three point bending test in a 100 kN universal testing machine with acoustic emission monitoring. The effects of temperature and basalt fiber hybridisation on the damage initiation, propagation and onset of failure were investigated using the magnitude of AE cumulative counts at different stages of loading. The results show a reduction in impact strength and residual flexural strength after impact at elevated temperatures. Lower impact resistance shown in the impact test results for all three types of composites at elevated temperatures indicate the effect of temperature which leads to inferior impact properties. It was evidenced from the impact and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) carried out on the composites that hybrid composites have better residual flexural strength and impact properties compared to non-hybrid composites.},

Dynamic tests for various environmental temperatures are performed on hydraulic jack equipped with an environmental chamber. Three speeds, between 8.33 · 10−4 m s−1 and 0.5 m s−1, at three temperatures (20 °C, −40 °C and −100 °C) are tested. The increase of the shear modulus with the decrease of the temperature is more pronounced between −40 °C and −100 °C than between 20 °C and −40 °C. Complementary DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) tests are performed on the M21 epoxy resin to characterise the viscoelastic behaviour of the matrix which contributes to the viscoelastic behaviour of the laminate. DMA tests highlight a low temperature transition called β transition (−67 °C for the 1 Hz test) which is responsible of the larger increase of the storage modulus, for the epoxy matrix, between −40 °C and −100 °C. Consequently the β transition could also be at the origin, for the composite, of the observed larger increase of the shear modulus with respect to the strain rate, for strain rates higher than 10 s−1.},

The measured data is used to generate material models which describe the mechanical behaviour as a function of conversion and temperature. The in-plane thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the composite material decreases above the glass transition temperature (Tg), which is compensated by a higher out of plane deformation above Tg. Comparison of α and chemical shrinkage measurements suggests that chemical bonds between the polymer matrix and the glass fibres are formed prior to shrinkage of the epoxy matrix, i.e., at an early processing stage. This suggests that production of composites with low residual stresses requires focus on reactivity between the matrix and the sizing rather than the matrix cure properties. As a consequence, residual stresses in the composite material are mainly a result of restricted cure shrinkage rather than mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients.},

The results showed that the scatter within each laboratory was acceptable but the scatter between laboratories for a particular test was high.

	abstract = {The thermal expansion behavior of three epoxy-fiberglass composite specimens was measured from 20 to 120°C (70 to 250°F) using a fused quartz push-rod dilatometer. Billets produced by vacuum-impregnating layers of two types of fiberglass cloth with an epoxy were core-drilled to produce cylindrical specimens. These were used to study expansion perpendicular and parallel to the fiberglass layers. This type of composite is used to separate the copper conductors that form a helical field coil in the Advanced Toroidal Facility, a plasma physics experiment operated by the Fusion Energy Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The coil is operated in a pulsed mode and expansion data were needed to assess cracking and joint stresses due to expansion of the copper-composite system. The dilatometer is held at a preselected temperature until steady state is indicated by stable length and temperature data. Before testing the composite specimens, a reliability check of the dilatometer was performed using a copper secondary standard. This indicated thermal expansion coefficient (α) values within ±2\% of expected values from 20 to 200°C. The percentage expansion of the composite specimen perpendicular to the fiberglass layers exceeded 0.8\% at 120°C, whereas that parallel to the fiberglass layers was about 0.16\%. The expansion in the perpendicular direction was linear to about 70°C, with an α value of over 55×10−6 °C−1. Anomalous expansion behavior was noted above 70°C. The expansion in the direction parallel to the fiberglass layers corresponds to an α value of about 15×10−6 °C−1. The lower α values in the parallel direction are consistent with the restraining action of the fiberglass layers. The α values decreased with the specimen density and this is consistent with literature data on composite contraction from 20 to −195°C.},

	abstract = {The thermo-mechanical characterization of interfaces in composite systems (PMC/MMC/IMC/CMC) is one of the challenging problems in composite mechanics and engineering. Each system has its own distinguishing features; however, in MMCs and IMCs the study is rendered more complex due to the evolving chemical species (both temporally and spatially), and the multi-axial state of residual stresses. Before MMCs or IMCs can be used in actual applications, the role of interfaces in not only the strengthening but also toughening mechanisms needs to be clearly understood. For evaluating the interfacial mechanical properties of interfaces, thin slice push-out test has emerged as the de-facto standard. Though, conceptually the testing procedure is simple, interpretation of the test results is not. It is essential to conduct very careful experiments, make precise meso- and macroscopic chemical/structural/mechanical observations and perform a thorough theoretical/numerical simulation before the test data can be used in a quantitative manner. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the push-out test is presented based on the theoretical/numerical and experimental research work of the authors’ group during the past few years.

In this work, thin slice push-out tests were conducted primarily on Titanium Matrix Composites at various test temperatures (room and elevated) with different processing conditions (temperature and time). Different composite systems with Titanium based matrices (Ti–6Al–4V, Timetal 21S, Ti–15Nb–3Al) uniaxially reinforced with Silicon Carbide fibers (SCS-6) were chosen for the study. Effect of the evolution of interfacial chemistry and architecture (in matrix, coating and reaction zone) on both shear strength τs and frictional strength τf were studied. A novel finite element analysis based on nonlinear finite element method was implemented, in which not only the initiation but propagation of interfacial cracks are simulated. In the analysis, both shear stress and fracture energy based criteria are used to model the initiation of (closed) cracks. Quantitative values of τs, τf, GI and GII are then extracted based on the experimental data and the numerical simulation. A critical review of stress and energy based interface-modeling approaches and their applicability to various boundary value problems are made.},

Microscopy observation on tested microbond samples which had exhibited decreasing interfacial friction after debonding revealed considerable residual resin around the debonded area of samples. Further investigation indicated that this unexpected difference was caused by the variation in mechanical properties of the matrix due to thermal degradation during sample fabrication.},

In order to obtain information on the temperature dependence of glass fibre–polypropylene IFSS a thermo-mechanical analyser has been adapted to enable interfacial microbond testing to be carried out in a well controlled temperature environment. Test results obtained by TMA-microbond testing showed excellent comparability with those obtained by normal microbond testing. The temperature dependence of IFSS of glass fibre–polypropylene was measured in the range from −40 °C up to 100 °C. The IFSS showed a highly significant inverse dependence on testing temperature with a major increase in the glass transition region of the PP matrix. It is shown that approximately 70\% of the apparent room temperature IFSS in this system can be attributed to residual radial compressive stress at the fibre–matrix interface.},

The change in debonding load is also followed as the interface degrades during moisture conditioning at different points through the thickness of the material.

	abstract = {Polymer matrix fibre reinforced composites are usually cured at an elevated temperature and then cooled to ambient conditions. Because of their heterogeneous nature and the very dissimilar expansion/contraction behaviour and mechanical properties of the two components thermal stresses are easily generated and can prove troublesome. The effects are exacerbated by thermal cycling, which can occur in a working environment. Furthermore, composites are usually employed at a temperature within ∼150°C of the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the matrix and in extreme conditions within ∼20°C or less of Tg. This tends to be a harsher thermal environment than is experienced by other materials and can lead to degradation of the composite and a reduction in properties. Both effects, thermal cycling and thermal degradation, are surveyed in this two-part paper with, mainly, reference to work reported during the last decade. For thermal cycling most work has involved carbon-fibres, principally with a modulus in the range 250–300 GPa and a CTE of −0.3–1×10−6 °C−1, along the fibre axis, compared with properties for the polyimide and epoxy matrices of ∼3 GPa and ∼50×10−6 °C−1, respectively. With a 100°C temperature change and a unidirectional laminate stresses of ±15 MPa can be generated, with somewhat higher values for a typical 0/90 laminate (the type most often studied experimentally). Under thermal cycling damage, mainly matrix cracking resulting in reduced flexural and transverse properties, was widely reported and the role of moisture and volatiles in reducing cracking, noted. Unfortunately the simple theoretical treatment developed some time ago was rarely used in assessing the results.},

The key issues like CNT dispersion and its stability during the processing steps and the final mechanical properties of composites are discussed in detail. The temperature–viscosity profile of the epoxy matrix reinforced with different types of CNTs indicated a strong dependency on the type of CNTs. The pronounced effect of the presence of CNTs in the matrix is reflected by the decrease of the coefficient of thermal expansion by ∼32\% for the double-walled CNTs epoxy system. There is also a substantial increase in fracture toughness Mode-1 by over 80\% for the pristine multi-walled CNTs in combination with the epoxy resin modified by using a compatibilizer. The influence of such CNT-resin modification also induced overall positive trends in all the mechanical properties that were evaluated.},

The model is generally applicable to other composite materials. The change of stiffness (E modulus) and also the chemical shrinkage of the material during cure is implemented in the model. The developed closed form solution is based on the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) and an additional term depending on the cure shrinkage. The development of residual stresses can be predicted during cure for both free and constrained (moulded) cure of composite laminates. The input material parameters are determined and used in the model to predict the elastic response of FMLs upon manufacturing. Predictions are compared to simulations with experimental data already obtained for this kind of material. The needed improvements for prediction of the residual stresses and final distortions of FMLs are outlined as the future works.},

Quantitative analyses of transverse matrix cracking by means of microscopy and X radiography have shown the accelerating effect of an oxidative atmosphere. Moreover, the higher the oxygen concentration, the more significant the acceleration of the cracking development. These results are analysed in terms of matrix oxidation, occurring at the highest temperatures of the cycle, and fatigue matrix cracking, occurring at the lowest ones and due to the prevented differential expansions of the plies. During a thermal cycling test performed in an oxidative atmosphere, a coupling effect between these two damage mechanisms would result in the acceleration of the micro cracking observed.},
